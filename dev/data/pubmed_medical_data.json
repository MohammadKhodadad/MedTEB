While Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi cut prices on long-acting basal insulin, among others, significantly, these insulins are not on SA's Essential Medicines List (EML) for primary healthcare. With a high prevalence of diabetes, especially pre-diabetes, in the country, the EML's neglect of newer long-acting insulin treatments hampers effective disease management. Despite efforts by the public and private sectors, insulin therapy initiation is delayed, impacting long-term outcomes. The introduction of smart insulin pens adds a technological dimension, but concerns persist about equitable access.

This rare subtype can be effectively visualized using ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, which reveal characteristic cystic-solid nodules. Histopathologically, EPC is defined by a papillary tumor structure with a well-defined fibrous capsule, devoid of myoepithelial cells both within and around the capsule. Immunohistochemical staining for myoepithelial markers is essential to confirm the absence of these cells, thereby validating the diagnosis of EPC. At the molecular level, EPC exhibits feature similar to estrogen receptor-positive invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), with a biological behavior that lies between ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and IDC. Generally, EPC has a favorable prognosis, associated with minimal recurrence and metastatic potential. Therapeutic strategies for EPC may parallel those for DCIS, including surgical excision. Adjuvant radiotherapy is recommended following surgery for patients with concurrent DCIS or those who have undergone breast-conserving therapy. In cases with associated IDC, management prioritizes the treatment of the invasive component. High-grade EPC often requires systemic therapies due to its poorer prognosis and increased risk of lymph node involvement.",

Diagnosing HCM requires a thorough examination of clinical symptoms, with echocardiography as the key initial imaging tool. Multimodality imaging further supports diagnosis, helps assess left ventricular outflow obstruction, and aids in risk stratification for sudden cardiac death. The cornerstone of HCM management remains pharmacological therapy with \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers serving as first-line agents to alleviate symptoms and reduce left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. More recently, cardiac myosin inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment paradigm for obstructive HCM. Procedural interventions such as septal reduction therapy are reserved for refractory cases. Genetic testing and risk stratification for sudden cardiac death play a critical role in treatment decisions, guiding further testing in first-degree relatives and ICD implantation in high-risk individuals.

Objective: To evaluate the utilization of an advanced robotic chemotherapy drug compounding system (APOTECAchemo) at a Community Cancer Center (CCC), examining accuracy, efficiency, and staff perceptions. Methods: This single-center, retrospective study evaluated the preparation of 7 intravenous (IV) antineoplastics at a CCC over a 1-year period. We compared manual methods with the APOTECAchemo system. The primary measure of accuracy was the absolute drug error percentage, with a comparison of pass and fail rates. Secondary endpoints included the overall use of APOTECAchemo for all IV antineoplastic preparations and average preparation times. An end-user satisfaction survey gathered feedback from pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. Results: A total of 8210 doses were prepared at the CCC, with 52.1% compounded by APOTECAchemo and 47.9% manually. Of these, the CCC prepared 5526 doses of the 7 routinely compounded antineoplastics. APOTECAchemo prepared 3851 (69.7%) doses, while manual compounding accounted for 1675 (30.3%) doses. The average absolute drug error was 1.44% (95% CI, 1.35-1.53) with robot compounding versus 1.17% (95% CI, 1.03-1.32) with manual (P P Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the successful implementation, extensive utilization, and high accuracy of both APOTECAchemo and manual compounding methods in the preparation of routinely administered antineoplastics at a CCC.",

Various tools, such as electronic alerts, standardized order sets, and rapid response teams, are used to expedite sepsis bundled care, yet their individual effects on outcomes and antimicrobial timing are unclear. This study evaluated the impact of an Inpatient Code Sepsis protocol, featuring an overhead page and order set, on mortality in hospitalized patients with sepsis and septic shock. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a 371-bed hospital from July 1, 2020, to July 31, 2023. Hospitalized adults (\u226518 years) diagnosed with sepsis and septic shock before and after the Inpatient Code Sepsis protocol implementation were included. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality; secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay, 30-day readmission, and time to antibiotic administration. Patients were excluded if they were identified for sepsis without infection, had sepsis due to non-bacterial causes, lost to follow-up within 30 days of admission, received empiric antibiotics in an emergency department or outside hospital, or were missing antibiotic administration time. Results: A total of 138 patients were included in the analysis. Mortality within 30 days did not significantly differ preprotocol and postprotocol (p = 0.381). However, a significant reduction in time to antibiotic administration was noted postimplementation (p Conclusion: The Inpatient Code Sepsis protocol did not impact 30-day mortality but did improve the time to antibiotic administration.",

Moreover, the prognosis of women post-AMI is poor when compared with men of similar ages. Since the 1990s, an abundant literature has highlighted the existing differences between sexes with regard to presentation, burden, and impact of traditional risk factors and of risk factors pertaining predominantly to women, the perception of risk by women and men, and the pathophysiological causations, their treatment, and prognosis. These data that have been accumulated over recent years highlight several targets for improvement. The objective of this collaborative work is to define the actions required to reverse the growing incidence of AMI in women and improve the patient pathway and care, as well as the prognosis. We aim to provide practical toolkits for different health professionals involved in the care of women, so that each step, from cardiovascular risk assessment to symptom recognition, to the AMI pathway and rehabilitation, thus facilitating that from prevention to intervention of AMI, can be optimized.",

We report the case of a 34-year-old female presenting with persistent bloody discharge and nipple erosion, for which multimodal ultrasound evaluation was pivotal in the differential diagnosis. Ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic, well-defined nodule in the left nipple, with significant blood flow and a fast-in-fast-out contrast enhancement pattern, indicative of NA. Despite the presentation mimicking malignant processes, the benign nature of the lesion was confirmed postoperatively via histology and immunohistochemistry. This case underscores the value of a comprehensive ultrasound approach in diagnosing NA, emphasizing its ability to distinguish it from malignant lesions, and thus infer an appropriate treatment course. Maintaining a high index of suspicion coupled with tailored ultrasound techniques is recommended for accurate NA diagnosis, which remains a challenging yet critical task to avoid unnecessary aggressive interventions.",

In Singapore, there is growing interest in delivering frailty intervention programmes at scale in the community to meet the demands of an ageing population. New methods of programme delivery such as community-led models that do not rely on healthcare professional manpower are critical to address this unmet need. In this paper, we describe our experience and some lessons learned from the implementation of a community-based early frailty intervention programme for older adults, delivered for the first time by trained laypersons. From August to September 2022, \"Steady Lah,\" a community-based early frailty intervention programme with physical activity and nutrition-based elements, was conducted at an Active Ageing Centre in Singapore. A total of 23 participants with mean age of 73.8\u2009years were enrolled in the 12-session programme comprising of progressive strength and balance-based exercises and workshop-based learning focusing on nutrition. In the implementation of this run of \"Steady Lah,\" modifications were made from a healthcare professional-led model to a trained layperson-led model with additional steps taken to ensure participant safety and assess overall effectiveness when delivered by trained laypersons. Good collaboration between stakeholders in healthcare institutions and the community is necessary to co-develop a model that prioritises the needs of the frail older adults.",

This study reports on a rare case of testicular tuberculosis diagnosed through CEUS. A 31-year-old male patient presented with two months of persistent right scrotal pain and swelling. Conventional scrotal ultrasound showed an enlarged right testicle with heterogeneous echogenicity and abundant color Doppler blood flow signals. CEUS demonstrated rapid contrast agent filling in the right testicle, followed by the appearance of several irregular regions, indicating perfusion deficits in these areas. Histopathological confirmation through ultrasound-guided biopsy revealed granulomatous inflammation with caseous necrosis, which is consistent with the diagnosis of testicular tuberculosis.

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors, and patients are often diagnosed at an advanced stage, posing a substantial risk to human health, so it is crucial to establish a model to forecast the prognosis of patients with lung cancer. Recent research has indicated that proteasome 20S subunit 6 (PSMB6) may be closely associated with anti-apoptotic pathways, and proliferation transduction signals in tumor cells of different tumors. However, the precise role of PSMB6 in the immunoregulatory processes within lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is yet to be elucidated. By analyzing the TCGA database, we discovered a positive correlation between the expression of PSMB6 and tumor growth trends, and lung adenocarcinoma patients with elevated PSMB6 expression levels had a worse prognosis. Our findings suggest a close correlation between PSMB6 expression levels, immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint gene expression, which suggests that PSMB6 may become a new independent prognostic indicator. In addition, we developed a prognostic model of PSMB6-regulated immune infiltration-associated genes by analyzing the link between PSMB6 and the immune microenvironment. This model can not only predict the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma but also forecasts the patient's reaction to immunotherapy. The validity of this research outcome has been confirmed by the GSE31210 and IMvigor210 cohorts. Analysis of the Kaplan-Meier Plotter database indicates that individuals with elevated levels of PSMB6 expression exhibit a poorer prognosis. Additionally, in vitro experiments demonstrated that knockdown of PSMB6 inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion of lung adenocarcinoma cells while promoting their apoptosis. Overall, our findings suggest that PSMB6 could remarkably influence the management and treatment of lung adenocarcinoma, opening new avenues for targeted immunotherapeutic strategies.",

        "abstract": "Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with or without streptococcal and other bacterial infections (PANDAS/CANS) are emerging as a featured pediatric disorder. Although there is some controversy regarding treatment approaches, especially related to the behavioral sequelae, we have hypothesized in other published work that it is characterized by the rapid onset of Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) in children. We propose utilizing a multi-systems biological approach involving the coupling of genetic addiction risk testing and pro-dopamine regulation (KB220/POLYGEN\u00ae) to help induce \"dopamine homeostasis\" in patients with PANDAS, especially those with known DNA-induced hypodopaminergia. This case study examines a 12-year-old Caucasian male with no prior psychiatric issues who presented with a sudden onset of severe anxiety, depression, emotional liability, and suicidal ideation. The patient underwent genotyping and the genetic addiction risk score (GARS) testing, which revealed risk polymorphisms in the dopamine D2 (-DRD2/ANKK (Taq1A), OPRM1 (A/G), DRD3 (C/T), and MAOA (4R) genes. These polymorphisms have been linked to hypodopaminergia. The patient was subsequently placed on research ID-KB220ZPBMPOLY (POLYGEN\u00ae), and albeit the possibility of bias, based upon self and parental assessment, a marked rapid improvement in psychiatric symptoms was observed. In the second phase of treatment (102 days utilizing KB220), the patient received standard antibody testing, which was positive for Lyme. Antibacterial therapy started immediately, and KB220z was discontinued to provide a wash-out period. A monotonic trend analysis was performed on each outcome measure, and a consistently decreasing trend was observed utilizing antibacterial therapy. Our recommendation, albeit only one case, is to utilize and further research a combined therapeutic approach, involving precision-guided DNA testing and pro-dopamine regulation along with antibacterial therapy, as well as glutathione to address offensive enhanced cytokines, in patients with suspected PANDAS/CANS.",

Methods Overall, 35 patients with LABC were included in the study. Information on demographic profile, medical history, and signs and symptoms was collected for each patient, and a complete clinical evaluation was conducted, which involved physical examination, imaging studies (mammogram/ultrasound imaging), biopsy of each patient, and a metastatic workup. Patient consent was obtained for core-needle biopsy under local anesthesia, followed by a\u00a0pathologic\u00a0assessment of the type of breast cancer, before NACT and after mastectomy. Patients treated with NACT were followed up for response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 and were scheduled for modified radical mastectomy (MRM) on completion of NACT. MRM specimens were sent for immunohistopathologic\u00a0analysis for CD3 and CD5, and for grading. Subsequently, correlations between TILs and grading with NACT response and type of cancer were analyzed. Results Of the 35 patients, 24 were positive for CD3. A correlation was identified between NACT in LABC patients and CD3 TILs, as 68.6% of patients were CD3-positive, with 54.3% showing stromal CD3 variants and 14.3% showing intramural CD3 variants. This result indicates that CD3 TILs can be an indicator of response to NACT in LABC patients. In the sample, 48.6% of patients showed CD5 positivity, with stromal predominance. Overall, 17 patients (48.6%) had a RECIST complete response to NACT, 16 (45.7%) had a partial response, and 1 (2.9%) had progressive disease. Therefore, the study showed a significant response to NACT in LABC patients (p-value < 0.0001), and reductions in tumor size could be evaluated using RECIST criteria. Conclusions NACT had a significant effect on tumors, as shown by RECIST assessments in patients with LABC. TILs can be used as promising prognostic markers to evaluate and predict patients' responses to NACT. Evaluating TILs is expensive but may be useful for the diagnosis and prediction of immunologic\u00a0responses in breast cancer and other types of carcinomas following chemotherapy.",

Objective: This retrospective analysis evaluated baseline characteristics, healthcare resource utilization, and costs among patients with agitation in Alzheimer dementia and those without agitation in Alzheimer dementia. Methods: Medicare beneficiaries from 100% of the Medicare Fee-for-Service claims database (2009-2016) with 2 or more claims 30 or more days apart for both Alzheimer's disease and dementia and continuous enrollment with medical/pharmacy coverage for 6 months before and 12 months after the index diagnosis were included. Patients with agitation in Alzheimer dementia were identified by 2 or more claims 14 or more days apart using International Classification of Diseases-9-CM/-10-CM codes based on the provisional International Psychogeriatric Association agitation definition. Patients with severe psychiatric disorders were excluded. Two cohorts of patients (with and without agitation) were then defined, and patient characteristics, healthcare resource utilization, and costs were compared in a descriptive exploratory analysis. Results: Of 2\u2009684\u2009704 Fee-for-Service patients with Alzheimer dementia, 769\u2009141 met all inclusion criteria; among these, 281\u2009042 (36.5%) had agitation. The mean age in patients with and without agitation in Alzheimer dementia was 83 years. Most patients in both groups were female, but the proportion of males was slightly higher in the agitation in Alzheimer dementia group (30.3% vs 28.2%, respectively). Patients with agitation in Alzheimer dementia were more likely than those without agitation in Alzheimer dementia to have lower socioeconomic status (dual eligibility for Medicaid, 45.0% vs 41.7%, respectively) or be disabled (10.5% vs 9.4%). Overall, healthcare costs were higher in the agitation in Alzheimer dementia population compared with those without agitation in Alzheimer dementia (mean cost PPPY, 32 \u2009 322 a n d 30\u2009121, respectively), with the largest differences observed in inpatient and post-acute care costs.

Using microarray data from the GEO database, differential gene expression analysis was conducted with the limma package, identifying significant genes in RA and OP. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) further examined gene relationships with the disease status, identifying co-expression patterns. Key genes were pinpointed by intersecting differentially expressed genes from RA and OP datasets with WGCNA module genes. Functional enrichment analysis using the \"clusterProfiler\" package focused on Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. Machine learning methods, including Lasso and Random Forest, refined the selection of key genes related to apoptosis. Immune infiltration analysis using CIBERSORT assessed immune cell differences between disease and normal samples. The study highlighted two crucial genes: ATXN2L and MMP14. These genes were identified through various analyses and found to be significantly associated with the progression of RA and OP. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of ATXN2L and MMP14 revealed their involvement in specific biological processes and pathways. Correlation analysis between these key genes and immune cell infiltration showed significant associations. The ROC analysis evaluated the diagnostic performance of ATXN2L and MMP14, with miRNA regulatory networks related to these genes also predicted. In summary, this research provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of RA and OP, emphasizing the importance of apoptosis and immune processes.",

While ETI therapy significantly enhanced exocrine pancreatic function, it led to hepatotoxicity, necessitating therapy discontinuation. Attempts to restart ETI at reduced doses were unsuccessful due to persistent hepatic dysfunction. Reduced ETI dosing frequency, implemented due to hepatic dysfunctions, did not result in substantial therapeutic benefits. Clinical markers showed a resurgence of severe EPI and sustained need for gastrostomy tube feeds, with only modest improvement in hepatic function compared to the period following ETI cessation or during prior use of CFTR modulator therapy with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. This case underscores the importance of personalized therapeutic approaches, biomarker-guided monitoring, and multidisciplinary insights to optimize CF management while also highlighting the ongoing need for research to mitigate hepatotoxicity risks and ensure long-term therapeutic efficacy.",

The consequences of DUs include a decline in functional status, increased risk of infection, hospitalization, and even death. Our study revealed a significant decrease in the levels of cortistatin (CST) in the skin tissue of patients with DUs and diabetic rats. This finding led us to hypothesize that the administration of exogenous CST is an effective strategy to promote wound healing in patients with DUs. We herein successfully prepared CST-loaded pDMA-pEPEMA nanoparticles (CST@NPs) designed to exhibit localized, acid-responsive behavior for enhanced wound healing. These CST@NPs were sensitive to acidic environments, triggering the rapid release of CST. In vitro experiments showed that CST@NPs effectively alleviated oxidative stress and reduced apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Our findings further demonstrated that CST@NPs accelerated re-epithelialization of the wound, enhanced collagen deposition, and stimulated angiogenesis, while alleviating the local inflammatory response. Both in vivo and in vitro results indicate that CST@NPs possess precise and rapid response capabilities in acidic environments, ensuring effective CST release to promote diabetic wound healing. In summary, this acid-responsive nanoparticle system presents a highly efficient therapeutic strategy for the treatment of chronic diabetic wounds.",

However, existing clinical decision support systems have primarily targeted a particular patient demographic with unique medical conditions and focused on a single type of blood transfusion. This study aims to develop an advanced machine learning-based model to predict the probability of transfusion necessity over the next 24 h for a diverse range of non-traumatic ICU patients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 72,072 non-traumatic adult ICU patients admitted to a high-volume US metropolitan academic hospital between 2016 and 2020. We developed a meta-learner and various machine learning models to serve as predictors, training them annually with 4-year data and evaluating on the fifth, unseen year, iteratively over 5 years. Results: The experimental results revealed that the meta-model surpasses the other models in different development scenarios. It achieved notable performance metrics, including an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.97, an accuracy rate of 0.93, and an F1 score of 0.89 in the best scenario. Conclusion: This study pioneers the use of machine learning models for predicting the likelihood of blood transfusion receipt in a diverse cohort of critically ill patients. The findings of this evaluation confirm that our model not only effectively predicts transfusion reception but also identifies key biomarkers for making transfusion decisions.",

We report a unique case of a 75-year-old Caucasian patient with a history of multiple comorbidities including obesity, arterial hypertension, total thyroidectomy, rheumatoid arthritis, and prior venous thrombosis. The patient presented with pain, functional impairment, and signs of inflammation in the left knee seven months post-TKA. An active fistula was also noted. Initial management with broad-spectrum antibiotics did not halt the progression of infection, prompting further diagnostic evaluation. Actinomyces europaeus was identified as the causative agent through cultures and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). A two-stage surgical intervention was necessitated, involving removal of the infected prosthesis followed by reimplantation with an antibiotic-impregnated spacer. This case highlights the importance of considering rare organisms like Actinomyces europaeus in atypical PJI.

This systematic review evaluates the current literature on the use of intravesical therapies as an alternative treatment for rUTIs. Two established primary therapies are reviewed: glycosaminoglycan (GAG) instillations and intravesical antibiotic instillations. Both therapies offer localised treatment, reducing systemic antibiotic exposure and targeting infection sites more directly. A literature search was conducted using PubMed and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL), yielding 5,963 relevant articles, of which seven studies met the inclusion criteria. The review indicates that both GAG and antibiotic instillations significantly reduce UTI recurrence rates and improve symptoms such as pain and urinary urgency. However, significant variations in treatment schedules and dosages exist, and no direct comparative studies between GAG instillations and intravesical antibiotics were found. Moreover, intravesical antibiotics show great potential in minimising antimicrobial resistance, though further large-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings. While intravesical therapies are generally well-tolerated, GAG instillations can cause mild irritation. Further research is required to optimise therapy regimens and to perform cost-benefit analyses, particularly considering the high costs of these therapies compared to traditional antibiotic prophylaxis. Randomised controlled trials comparing different intravesical treatments are crucial to inform future clinical practice.",

Audits enable the departments and laboratories to meet the changing needs of the healthcare environment by giving a detailed picture of the department's operations and highlighting areas for possible growth and development. Aims and objectives This study focuses on the biopsies received in the Oral Pathology Department at Saveetha Dental College, aiming to evaluate biopsy trends, financial performance, and resource utilization over one year. Materials and methods The oral pathology department audit covered the period from 1st April 2023 to 31st March 2024. The institutional human ethical committee and scientific review board approved the retrospective audit. It involved a comprehensive analysis of biopsy data, financial records, and material usage. Data on different biopsy types (excisional, incisional, frozen sections), immunohistochemistry, cytology, and special stains were collected and analyzed across four quarters. Financial performance was assessed by comparing total income and expenses, while resource utilization was examined through the use of histopathological blocks and other consumables. Statistical analysis (chi-square) was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23 (Released 2015; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). A P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results We received 1100 cases during the study period. Excisional biopsies were the most common, with 474 (43.09%) cases, followed by incisional biopsies with a total of 432 (39.27%). Out of total cases of 1100, the second quarter (July-September 2023) had the highest case volume of 305 (27.72%), while the third quarter (October-December 2023) recorded the lowest of 250 (22.72%) cases. A financial audit revealed an annual deficit of \u20b91,03,321 primarily due to higher expenses towards laboratory reagents. The overall expense incurred per case was \u20b9448.5. Tissue blocks cost \u20b985.23 per case (19.00%) of the average cost per case. The chi-square test analysis was insignificant among the different types of biopsies and the reagent consumption across the four quarters.\u00a0 Conclusion The audit identified critical areas for improvement in both clinical workload and financial management. High volumes of biopsies, but net financial deficits highlight the need for better cost management and resource utilization strategies to maintain sustainability without compromising diagnostic quality.",

        "abstract": "Tibial shaft fractures are a prevalent and challenging orthopedic injury, often resulting from high-energy trauma. Optimal management of these fractures is crucial to prevent complications such as nonunion, malunion, and prolonged functional impairment. Intramedullary nailing (IMN) is widely regarded as the gold standard for treating these injuries due to its ability to provide stable fixation, preserve soft tissues, and enable early mobilization. However, the timing of surgical intervention remains a topic of ongoing debate. Early surgical intervention, defined as surgery within 24-48 hours of injury, is advocated for its potential to reduce hospital stay, facilitate early mobilization, and decrease the risk of secondary complications such as compartment syndrome. Conversely, delayed intervention allows for patient stabilization and reduction of soft tissue swelling, potentially lowering the risk of infection and other complications. This comprehensive review aims to evaluate the impact of surgical timing on fracture healing outcomes in tibial shaft fractures treated with IMN. It explores the benefits and limitations of early versus delayed surgery, emphasizing their influence on union rates, healing time, and complication rates. Furthermore, the review examines different IMN techniques, including reamed versus unreamed and static versus dynamic nailing, to determine their role in optimizing fracture healing. By synthesizing current evidence, this review provides critical insights into the optimal timing and technique for IMN in tibial shaft fractures, ultimately aiming to guide clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes. Future research should focus on randomized controlled trials to establish standardized surgical timing and technique selection guidelines in this patient population.",

        "abstract": "Background Cataract is the leading cause of blindness globally, particularly in India. Despite advancements in surgical techniques, postoperative complications remain common, with posterior capsular opacification (PCO) being the most frequent issue. Although neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser capsulotomy is recommended for managing PCO, it is associated with various side effects. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy on intraocular pressure (IOP), visual acuity, anterior chamber depth (ACD), macular thickness, and corneal endothelium in Indian patients. Methodology This prospective, hospital-based study was conducted in the ophthalmology department at a tertiary care center in western Maharashtra from September 2022 to June 2024. Approval from the Institutional Scientific and Ethics Committee was obtained before commencing the research. In the study, 72 eyes from 72 patients with PCO following uncomplicated cataract surgery who were undergoing Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy were included, whereas patients with corneal pathology, retinal pathology, complicated cataract surgery, or trauma were excluded. Patients with active uveitis, non-compliant patients, and those unwilling to undergo the procedure were also excluded. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Data were managed in Microsoft Excel, and statistical analysis was conducted using the SPSS 26.0 software. As the continuous variables exhibited skewed distribution, the Wilcoxon test was employed to assess categorical variables such as the significance of IOP and endothelial cell differences over time. A significance level of 5% was assumed, with a p-value below 0.05 considered significant. Results The mean age of patients who underwent Nd:YAG capsulotomy was 64 years, with a female predominance of 37 (51.4%). In the study, 37 (51.4%) patients had their left eye treated, while 35 (48.6%) had their right eye treated. Overall, 45 (62.5%) patients had a baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 6/24-6/12. At one hour post-procedure, 46 (63.9%) patients in Group II had a BCVA of 6/24-6/12, and by one week after treatment, 53 (73.6%) patients had a BCVA of >6/12-6/6. ACD was normal in all patients before and after the procedure. Two patients developed macular edema at one hour and one week after the procedure. The mean IOP at baseline, one hour, and one week were 13.5, 13.86, and 13.69 mmHg, respectively. A significant increase in IOP was observed at one hour post-procedure, along with a significant decrease in endothelial cell count compared to baseline, which also persisted at one week. Conclusions Patients undergoing Nd:YAG capsulotomy experienced an initial rise in IOP, followed by a subsequent decline. Improved visual acuity was noted in most patients at one hour and by one week. A significant decline in endothelial cell count was observed following the procedure, and macular edema was noted in two patients. Anterior chamber reaction was observed in nearly all patients, which decreased by one week. With no change in ACD following the procedure up to one week, ocular refraction was not significantly impacted in the short term. Therefore, further large-scale intervention studies are needed to evaluate the effects of Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy size and the energy used on refractive error and post-procedure complications, as well as to explore the long-term effects on IOP.",

        "abstract": "Primary pulmonary lymphoma (PPL) is an uncommon condition involving the lungs, characterized by the abnormal clonal growth of lymphoid cells. Patients with PPL can be asymptomatic or present with vague clinical signs such as cough, fever, chest discomfort, and shortness of breath. Some may also have underlying immunosuppression or autoimmune conditions. Tuberculosis being more common with a higher incidence in endemic areas, PPL can often be misdiagnosed as tuberculosis. Also, they share common symptoms like cough, fever, fatigue, unexplained weight loss, and an upper lobe predilection. Therefore, diagnosing PPL from other common pulmonary diseases is of utmost importance in early diagnosis and treatment. Generally, small biopsy samples are essential for precise diagnosis and prompt treatment. Therapeutic options include chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and surgical intervention. Herewith we outline a case initially presented as acanthosis nigricans, referred with respiratory symptoms, pleural effusion, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which was primarily thought to be a tuberculous pleural effusion. Apart from clinicoradiological and laboratory analysis, thoracoscopy-guided biopsy and histopathological examination pointed toward further steps in diagnosis. The patient was initiated on chemotherapy with an R-CHOP regimen. This case depicts the call for a multidisciplinary perspective for the definite and expeditious diagnosis and management of a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with diffuse large B cell lymphoma. This discussion also highlights the need for a thorough evaluation of paraneoplastic syndromes, as they are crucial in the early diagnosis of the disease and in identifying relapses.",

        "abstract": "Background Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) presents significant challenges in its management, not only due to the technical complexity of the procedure but also because it is primarily performed on elderly patients who often have multiple comorbidities, making perioperative care and post-procedural recovery more intricate and demanding. The study's objective is to discover the challenges faced during the TAVI procedure and the frequency of complications that occurred during and after the procedure. Methods This is a single-centre retrospective study. Patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, considered at high risk for conventional surgical aortic valve replacement, were included, their medical records were extracted, and data were collected. Endpoints at one-year follow-up comprised one-year mortality, cause of death, and valve dysfunction. Procedural-related complications were also noted as procedural-related outcomes. Results The mean age and body mass index (BMI) of the patients were 73.9 years and 28.3 kg/m2, respectively. The main comorbidities were hypertension (n = 33, 84.6%), diabetes mellites (n = 21, 53.8%), ischemic heart disease (n = 6, 15.38%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 5, 12.8%). The mean European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) was 5.75% with a median of 2.38%. General anaesthesia was received (n = 27), whereas the rest of the cases were performed under monitored anaesthesia care (MAC). None of the patients developed surgical site hematoma or massive blood loss. Post-operative mechanical ventilation was required in three patients (10.2%), and two (5.12%) of them expired in the intensive care unit. One patient had on-table mortality. Conclusion A low rate of anaesthesia and procedural-related complications was observed. The TAVI procedures done in our centre are promising and parallel to the finest global centres' outcomes in terms of procedural triumph and complication rate.",

        "title": "Decoding Acute Scrotum: Diagnostic Accuracy of Ultrasound in Urgent Clinical Settings.",
        "abstract": "Background Acute scrotum is a medical emergency commonly encountered in clinical practice, particularly in pediatric and adolescent populations. It is characterized by sudden onset of scrotal pain and may involve swelling, redness, or tenderness. The most common etiologies include testicular torsion, epididymo-orchitis, trauma, and, less frequently, tumors. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical, especially in cases of testicular torsion, where timely surgical intervention is required to preserve testicular viability. Ultrasound (US), particularly high-resolution gray-scale imaging combined with color Doppler (CD), has emerged as the primary imaging modality for evaluating acute scrotal conditions due to its accessibility, non-invasiveness, and high diagnostic accuracy. Aims and objectives This study aims to assess the diagnostic accuracy of US in differentiating the causes of acute scrotum, specifically focusing on testicular torsion, epididymo-orchitis, and varicocele. We also evaluate its role in reducing unnecessary surgical explorations and improving clinical decision-making in urgent settings. Materials and methods This retrospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary care center in Puducherry, India. A total of 250 male patients, ranging in age from 10 to 70 years, presented with acute scrotal pain over the 12-month study period. Inclusion criteria included all patients with sudden scrotal pain, regardless of clinical suspicion of underlying pathology. US scans were performed using a 7.5- to 12-MHz linear transducer. Gray-scale imaging was used to evaluate the testes, epididymis, spermatic cord, scrotal wall, and inguinal region, while CD was used to assess vascular flow. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS Version 18 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Diagnostic accuracy was calculated based on sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Results The most common cause of acute scrotum was inflammatory pathology, including epididymo-orchitis, accounting for 56.4% of cases (141 patients). Varicocele was the second most common cause, diagnosed in 11.6% of patients (29 cases), while hernias and epididymal cysts were found in 8% and 7.6% of cases, respectively. Testicular torsion was diagnosed in 2% of cases (five patients). US demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for inflammatory pathologies, with sensitivity and specificity reaching 97% and 96%, respectively. The sensitivity for testicular torsion was 62%, reflecting the challenges in diagnosing partial or intermittent torsion, while specificity was high at 99%. US's performance in identifying varicocele was excellent, with a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 98%. Conclusion US, especially when combined with CD, is an indispensable tool in the emergency evaluation of acute scrotum. It provides high diagnostic accuracy for inflammatory pathologies and varicocele while serving as an effective screening modality for testicular torsion. This study reinforces the role of US in reducing unnecessary surgical explorations, guiding clinical management, and improving patient outcomes in urgent clinical settings.",

        "abstract": "Background Vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy is a frequent emergency department presentation and is associated with various obstetrical outcomes. Despite this, there has been limited research on the variables that predict less-than-preferred obstetrical outcomes in these cases. This study aims to identify predictors of preferred obstetrical outcomes for women presenting to the emergency department with early pregnancy bleeding. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of health records from an emergency department at a Canadian tertiary care center. Pregnant females presenting with vaginal bleeding before 20 weeks gestation were included. Variables analyzed included maternal age, gravidity, parity, hemoglobin levels, Rh status, cramping, socioeconomic status, and ultrasound findings. The primary outcome was a preferred outcome, defined as a full-term live birth (\u226537 weeks). Less-preferred outcomes included miscarriage, preterm birth, and stillbirth. Point-of-care ultrasound and radiology ultrasound findings were also evaluated. Results A total of 422 patients were screened, and 180 were included in the analysis. Overall, 75 (41.7%) patients had a preferred outcome, while 105 (58.3%) had a less-preferred outcome. The strongest predictor of a preferred outcome was the presence of a live intrauterine pregnancy with fetal heartbeat on\u00a0ultrasound, with a preferred outcome rate of 74.5% (56/76) (95% CI 59.8-88.7; p < 0.01) on point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), and 100% (65/65); p = 0.04 for radiology-performed ultrasound. In contrast, 80.8% (21/26) of patients with findings other than a live intrauterine pregnancy on\u00a0POCUS, and 100% (88/88) on radiology-performed ultrasound had a less-preferred outcome. Cramping with bleeding was associated with a higher rate of less-than-preferred outcomes (62.1%, 77/124; 95% CI 54.2-71.1; p = 0.07). Socioeconomic status was not a significant predictor, with similar outcomes above and below the poverty line. Anemia was associated with a 100% non-live birth rate, although only 5 patients were anemic. Conclusion Identification of a live intrauterine pregnancy on\u00a0ultrasound is a strong predictor of a preferred outcome in early pregnancy bleeding. POCUS has the advantage of being immediately available, whereas radiology-performed ultrasound may be more definitive as a predictor. Cramping and anemia may also be associated with less-preferred outcomes, though further research is needed to confirm these findings. These predictors may help guide clinical decision-making and improve counseling for patients presenting to the emergency department with early pregnancy bleeding.",

The patient's radiotherapy plan was generated on the Ethos system using an eight-field intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plan imported from the Eclipse planning system. The patient was prescribed 50.4Gy/28# over 5.5 weeks with concurrent carboplatin and paclitaxel.\u00a0There were no changes to our department's standard clinical tumour volume (CTV) and planning tumour volume (PTV) margins due to the novel nature of the case.\u00a0For each fraction of daily oART, the heart, right and left lungs, oesophagus and trachea were Ethos-contoured 'Influencer' structures which were reviewed and edited at the console. Minor edits were required to each structure.\u00a0The adaptive plan was chosen for each fraction due to showing clear dosimetric benefits to both PTV coverage and organ at risk (OAR) doses. Lung doses were significantly reduced with the course mean lung dose reduction of 8.1% and the Lung-CTV V20 reduction of 4.4%.\u00a0The treatment duration from the start of CBCT acquisition to the end of beam delivery averaged 19 minutes and 12 seconds.\u00a0The patient was able to tolerate the time on the bed without incident within the scheduled 30-minute appointment slot.\u00a0Our case demonstrates that significant inter-fraction anatomy changes occur in patients having radiotherapy after oesophagectomy.

        "abstract": "Introduction Chronic periodontitis is a prevalent inflammatory disease that leads to the destruction of tooth-supporting structures. Psychological stress is a potential risk factor for periodontitis, potentially exacerbating inflammation and impairing treatment outcomes. This study aims to explore the correlation between chronic stress and oral inflammatory burden, as measured by the Periodontal Inflamed Surface Area (PISA), in a sample population from Bhopal, India. Methods This randomized clinical study included 1,250 participants, divided into three groups: Group A (control, n=250), Group B (chronic periodontitis, n=500), and Group C (post-treatment chronic periodontitis, n=500). Participants underwent a comprehensive periodontal examination, including the calculation of PISA, and completed the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) to assess stress levels. Statistical analysis included Pearson's correlation to assess the relationship between PSS-10 scores and PISA, with comparisons among groups using analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results Group B exhibited significantly higher periodontal parameters and PSS-10 scores than Group A and Group C (p<0.001 for all comparisons). Group C showed significant improvements in both periodontal parameters and PSS-10 scores following treatment (p<0.001). A positive correlation was observed between PSS-10 scores and PISA in Group B (r=0.62, p<0.001), indicating that higher perceived stress was associated with increased oral inflammation in untreated chronic periodontitis. This correlation persisted after adjusting for confounders, including age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Conclusions Chronic stress is significantly associated with increased oral inflammatory burden in patients with chronic periodontitis, suggesting that stress may act as an independent risk factor for disease progression. Periodontal therapy reduces oral inflammation and alleviates psychological distress. Integrating stress management into periodontal treatment plans may enhance patient outcomes, highlighting the importance of a holistic approach to periodontal care.",

        "abstract": "The use of the illicit/illegal drug cocaine is associated with many acute medical complications that often progress to chronic health conditions. These complications can affect multiple organ systems and lead to widespread organ failure at times. It is a commonly portrayed narrative in today's society that the nefarious \"lacing\" of cocaine with fentanyl is the catalyst that leads to the majority of overdose deaths from this substance. While this fact is certainly true, it can often overshadow the additional important fact that a large swath of people sustain major medical complications or die every year from overdoses of cocaine that are not laced with any foreign substance. This case report details a 40-year-old man who was transported to the ED with altered mental status, agitation, and hyperthermia from suspected cocaine use. He had a history of drug abuse and had multiple hospitalizations in the last year for it. Upon arrival at the ED, he exhibited severe hyperthermia (107.1\u00b0F), tachycardia, and tachypnea and was unresponsive to stimuli. Initial lab results indicated significant leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and elevated cardiac troponins. The patient required intubation, aggressive cooling, and intravenous sedation. His clinical course was further complicated by demand ischemia, acute kidney injury, and transaminitis. During his hospitalization, cardiac catheterization ruled out significant coronary artery disease, suggesting that the elevated troponin was due to cocaine-induced vasospasm and myopericarditis. It was subsequently discovered that the patient had a brain lesion previously detected on a computed tomography (CT) scan that was not followed up with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by patient request. This lesion required neurosurgical evaluation, and it was concluded that there was no need for acute intervention. Following a long and complex intensive care unit (ICU) stay, the patient was eventually stabilized, extubated, and discharged with outpatient follow-up recommendations. This case underscores the multifactorial and systemic effects of cocaine toxicity, illustrating the acute dangers and chronic health implications of its use. It highlights the importance of prompt, multidisciplinary management in acute cases and the need for comprehensive long-term care strategies to address the underlying substance use disorder in the outpatient setting. The case adds to the growing body of literature on cocaine-related complications, offering insights into the challenges of managing such patients in a clinical setting.",

Adherence to self-monitoring of blood glucose is essential for effective management of diabetes. Despite the wide variety of glucometers and their clinical applicability, there is a lot of ambiguity regarding their accuracy. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate if three point-of-care glucometers using three different methods for the estimation of blood glucose fulfil the minimum accuracy needed by ISO15197:2013 when compared with the gold standard hexokinase test. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at two primary health care centers in Ernakulam district, which included 73 participants with diabetes and 73 without diabetes. We evaluated three different enzymes in the test glucometers: glucose dehydrogenase with pyrroloquinoline quinone (GDH-PQQ), glucose dehydrogenase with flavin adenine dinucleotide (GDH-FAD), and glucose oxidase (GOD). The glucometer readings were compared with the gold standard hexokinase test and ISO15197:2013 standards. To compare the accuracy of each glucometer with the reference method, the Bland-Altman plot was used and to evaluate the clinical significance of the differences between the glucometer and reference value the Clarke error grid analysis was performed. Results When compared with the gold standard hexokinase result, only 78.08% (GOD), 92.4% (GDH-PQQ), and 95.8 (GDH-FAD) of results were within the limits stipulated by ISO15197:2013. All three glucometers showed blood glucose results within zones A and B of the consensus error grid, implying that it is clinically acceptable, and the Bland-Altman plot showed that the GDH-FAD method had the narrowest range between the upper and lower limit of agreement and a minimum bias of -0.89. Conclusion Only one test glucometer with the GDH-FAD method met the ISO15197:2013 criteria. Glucometers must meet the accuracy standards for the safety of the patients.",

Advances in genetic testing (GT) and novel therapies, such as cardiac myosin inhibitors, have significantly impacted the diagnosis and management of HCM. This integrative review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and aimed to synthesize information regarding the impact of GT on the diagnosis and management of HCM patients. An electronic search was conducted on May 17, 2024, across PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases, covering January 2020 to May 2024. Inclusion criteria were studies involving adult HCM patients who underwent GT and follow-up. Exclusion criteria included non-human studies, pediatric cases, non-HCM-related GT, non-peer-reviewed articles, systematic reviews, conference abstracts, and editorials. From 1,155 articles identified, 42 met the inclusion criteria after applying filters and removing duplicates. GT identified pathogenic variants in a significant proportion of HCM patients, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and management. Key mutations were found in myosin binding protein C3 and myosin heavy chain 7 genes. GT facilitated personalized management strategies, including risk stratification for SCD and family screening. Patients with identified mutations often required closer monitoring and tailored treatments. GT has revolutionized the diagnosis and management of HCM. The integration of genetic data has improved risk stratification, facilitated early intervention, and enhanced patient outcomes. Despite these advances, challenges remain in identifying genetic variants in some patients, emphasizing the need for continuous improvement in genetic panels and diagnostic methods. This review highlights the significant role of GT in optimizing HCM care through precise risk assessment and tailored treatment strategies.",

        "abstract": "Purpose Midpole patellar fractures are traditionally fixed with an \"11-8\" metal tension band construct. However, this technique is rife with implant-related complications. This study aims to evaluate the radiographic and functional outcomes following \"all-suture\" fixation of mid-pole patellar fractures as compared to resorbable screw-augmented suture fixation. Methods We retrospectively studied a consecutive series of 18 patients, 9 each with mid-pole patellar fractures treated with all-suture fixation or suture fixation augmented with bioabsorbable cancellous screws in our institution. The hybrid fixation cohort was significantly older (p2 mm) at around four to six weeks postoperatively, for which all except one case from the hybrid fixation cohort achieved union thereafter. One patient from the hybrid fixation cohort had fibrous non-union and further fracture displacement. There was another case of mild fracture gapping and screw breakage on review of postoperative radiographs at three months from the hybrid fixation cohort. These patients recovered without surgical revision or implant removal. Conclusions Both non-metal fixation methods for mid-pole transverse patellar fractures proved to be radiographically and functionally comparable.",

        "abstract": "Introduction and aims The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide, especially in the management of critically ill patients. Accurate assessment of energy expenditure (EE) is crucial for providing optimal nutritional support and improving clinical outcomes in these patients. Indirect calorimetry (IC) is the preferred method for measuring EE, yet its use in critically ill COVID-19 patients has not been extensively documented. This study aims to evaluate EE in critically ill patients with and without COVID-19 to identify differences that may impact nutritional support strategies. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational study at a large tertiary university hospital, focusing on critically ill patients. The study compared calorimetry data between patients with and without COVID-19. Data collected included resting energy expenditure, energy expenditure per kilogram, and respiratory exchange rate quotient using IC. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS Version 28, with a significance level set at p < 0.05. Results The study included 95 critically ill patients, comprising 61 non-COVID-19 patients and 34 COVID-19 patients. It was found that COVID-19 patients had significantly lower Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II compared to their non-COVID-19 counterparts. Although no significant differences in energy needs over time were detected between the two groups or within the COVID-19 group alone, there was a trend towards lower energy needs in COVID-19 patients. Significant differences were noted in respiratory quotient among COVID-19 patients, particularly between those with and without pulmonary thromboembolism, with the latter group exhibiting lower RQ values. Conclusion Our study suggests that while overall EE may not significantly differ between critically ill COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, there are potential differences in substrate use that underline the necessity for individualized nutritional support. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring nutritional interventions to meet the specific needs of critically ill patients, particularly those with COVID-19.",

Franklinite nanostructures (ZnFe2O4) were synthesized via a green method and subsequently used as a support to stabilize cefixime (Cef). The successful formation of ZnFe2O4 nanostructures and subsequent loading of the drug was confirmed using various microscopic and spectroscopic analyses. Solubility measurements and dissolution tests for the franklinite stabilized cefixime (Cef-ZnFe2O4) indicated increased solubility, enhanced in vitro bioavailability and greater absorption under physiological conditions. Hemolytic assay affirmed the safety and efficacy of drug stabilized by franklinite. Biological assessment of Cef-ZnFe2O4 revealed that it has strong antifungal, antioxidant and kinase inhibition potential as compared to its bare counterpart. These findings emphasize the potential of newly designed Cef-ZnFe2O4 as a promising nanoformulation with enhanced solubility, efficacy, safety and biological activities.",

This study aims to evaluate the predictive value of blood biomarkers in determining the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), addressing a critical need for more personalized treatment strategies in clinical practice.",

This study aimed to develop a novel nanoparticle formulation to enhance wound healing by combining antimicrobial and photothermal therapy using albumin as a carrier for Tanshinone IIA and the near-infrared photothermal agent IR780. The nanoparticles were synthesized to exploit the antimicrobial effects of Tanshinone IIA and the photothermal properties of IR780 when exposed to near-infrared laser irradiation. Characterization of the nanoparticles was performed using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and spectroscopic analysis to confirm their successful synthesis. In vitro antibacterial activity was evaluated using cultures of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and in vivo efficacy was tested in a mouse model of MRSA-infected wounds. Wound healing progression was assessed over 16\u00a0days, with statistical analysis performed using two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test. The nanoparticles demonstrated significant photothermal properties, enhancing bacterial eradication and promoting the controlled release of Tanshinone IIA. In vitro studies showed superior antibacterial activity, especially under photothermal activation, leading to a substantial reduction in bacterial viability in MRSA cultures. In vivo, nanoparticle treatment combined with near-infrared laser irradiation significantly improved wound closure rates compared to controls and treatments without photothermal activation. By the 16th day post-treatment, significant improvements in wound healing were observed, highlighting the potential of the combined photothermal and pharmacological approach. These findings suggest that albumin-loaded nanoparticles containing Tanshinone IIA and IR780, activated by near-infrared light, could offer an effective therapeutic strategy for managing chronic and infected wounds, promoting both infection control and tissue repair.",

Our prior work had demonstrated that Trueperella pyogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are two important microorganisms in causing the abscess disease of forest musk deer, and furazolidone could inhibit the growth and virulence of the pathogens in vitro. In this study, the in vivo protection activity of furazolidone was evaluated by using mouse models chronically infected with T. pyogenes and P. aeruginosa. The results showed that furazolidone treatment significantly increased the survival rates of mice in the co-infection group, all the mice survived at 14 days post-infection. The damage degree of the lung tissues caused by bacterial infection was ameliorated by the treatment of furazolidone from 7 to 14 days post-infection, which also reduced the residual bacterial burden in the lungs. Compared to the untreated control group, the expression levels of genes activated by the quorum-sensing system of P. aeruginosa and the core virulence regulatory genes of T. pyogenes were significantly suppressed by furazolidone. In addition, the results of transcriptomic analyses showed that 270 DEGs were identified in the co-infection group. This finding further revealed that the immune responses of mice could be enhanced by the treatment of furazolidone, and this might also contribute to the clearance of bacteria from the lungs. Therefore, this study clearly reveals the protection activity of furazolidone against P. aeruginosa and T. pyogenes infection, and thus provides a promising candidate in the treatment of abscess disease.",

We evaluated late olfactory bulb (OB) imaging changes and their correlates with the olfactory function in otherwise neurologically asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Eighty-three subjects (mean-age 43\u00b114 years; 54 females; time-interval infection/MRI: 129\u00b168 days) affected by asymptomatic to mild COVID19 in 2020 and 25 healthy controls (mean-age 40\u00b113 years; 9 females) underwent 3T-MRI and olfactory function evaluation through anamnestic questionnaire and Sniffin' Sticks. Exclusion criteria were intensive care treatment or neurological involvement other than olfaction. Maximal OB area was measured blindly on high-resolution coronal T2w images by two observers. Patients were subdivided into: i) persistently hypo/anosmic, ii) recovered normosmic and iii) never complaining smell dysfunction with proven normal olfactory function. No significant differences were observed among patients' subgroups (p=0.76). Intra-observer and inter-observer reliability were high.(r=0.96 and 0.86). Former COVID19 patients had decreased mean maximal OB area than controls (6.52\u00b11.11mm2 vs 7.26\u00b11.17mm2, p=0.008) even when considering persistently hypo-anosmic (6.46\u00b10.90, p=0.006) or normosmic patients at MRI (6.57\u00b11.25, p=0.04).

This study aimed to identify influential variables in the success of this therapy, analyzing its personalized therapeutic potential for complex wounds. Approach: A prospective observational study was conducted in elderly patients with complex wounds receiving autologous PRP. Patient's data about sociodemographic parameters, comorbidities, frailty (FI-VIG score), complete blood count including albumin, wound depth, location, chronicity, and etiology were collected at the beginning of the study. The wound area was monitored weekly. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, longitudinal data analysis, and survival analysis. Results: Ninety-seven elderly patients were included. The FI-VIG, baseline wound area, depth, and etiology were significantly correlated with wound outcome. Strong differences in wound area variation from treatment initiation were observed in healed wounds (13% reduction/week) compared with stagnant and complicated wounds (1 and 2% reduction/week, respectively). The healing time analysis showed that nearly 80% of patients required at least 15 weeks for complete healing. In addition, patients with smaller wound sizes, younger age, or lower FI-VIG scores had shorter healing times. Innovation: This is the first study that identifies prognostic indicators for wound outcomes to guide clinician decision-making for using autologous PRP. It also highlights the relevance of patient health baseline and wound features and evolution for the success of this therapy. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that personalizing autologous PRP therapy to treat complex wounds in elderly patients is possible.",

The methodological approach was based on a literature review and a modified Delphi method, which involved blind voting and consensus evaluation using a Likert scale. This process was conducted over two rounds of online voting. The document covers six critical topics: the overall impact of austere conditions on critical care, airway management, analgesia, bleeding control, vascular access, and medical devices and equipment. In these settings, it is vital to apply basic care techniques flexibly, focusing on immediate bleeding control, airway management, and hypothermia treatment to reduce mortality. For airway management, rapid sequence intubation with ketamine for sedation and muscle relaxation is suggested. Effective pain management involves a multimodal approach, including patient-controlled analgesia by quickly acting safe drugs, with an emphasis on ethical palliative care when other options are unavailable. Regarding hemorrhage, military-derived protocols like Tactical Combat Casualty Care significantly reduced mortality and influenced the development of civilian bleeding control devices. Establishing venous access is crucial, with intraosseous access as a swift option and central venous access for complex cases, ensuring aseptic conditions. Lastly, selecting medical equipment that matches the specific logistical and medical needs is essential, maintaining monitoring standards and considering advanced diagnostic tools like point-of-care ultrasounds. Finally, effective communication tools for coordination and telemedicine are also vital.",

The evidence underpinning these conditions in the peer-reviewed literature requires robust critical evaluation for diagnostic use. Here, we present a structured curation process for Gene2Phenotype (G2P). This draws on multiple lines of clinical, bioinformatic and functional evidence. The process utilises and extends existing terminologies, allows for precise definition of the molecular basis of disease, and confidence levels to be attributed to a given gene-disease assertion. In-depth disease curation using this process will prove useful in applications including in diagnostics, research and development of targeted therapeutics. G2P: www.ebi.ac.uk/gene2phenotype .",

        "abstract": "Intra-articular fractures of the distal radius require anatomical reduction and stable fixation. When the fracture encompasses the articular facet of the bone, maintaining the reduction is challenging due to the fragment's size and high instability. While specific implants have been developed to fix this fragment, their effectives have been limited. This study evaluates the mechanical performance of a novel hook plate conceived to stabilize the small fragment of the semilunar facet of the radius in non-osteoporotic bones. A simulated lunate facet fracture was created in an adult radius in a virtual model, and a modification of a hook plate was developed using computer-aided design (CAD). Two groups were established for the finite element method (FEM) simulation: a control group (standard plate Medartis\u2122 (Switzerland, A-5500.23) and an angled plate with hooks set at 60\u00ba, 90\u00ba and 120\u00ba. In the FEM simulation, an axial load of 100\u00a0N was applied in the Z-axis direction on the fragment. Fracture displacement along the Z axis was more pronounced in the control model (0.32\u00a0mm) and less in the angled models, ranging from 0.22 to 0.28\u00a0mm. Notably, the plate with a 90\u00b0 angle showed a more effective reduction in fragment displacement. The distribution of stresses in the system showed the highest levels of stress in the control group (59.31\u00a0MPa), followed by the subgroup with a 60\u00b0 angle (55.78\u00a0MPa).In the side view, the control model showed a higher concentration of stresses (59.74\u00a0MPa), while the model with a 90\u00b0 angle showed a lower value of stresses (18.87\u00a0MPa). Critical stress regions were identified in the bolts of the control and 120\u00b0 models (59.47\u00a0MPa and 57.64\u00a0MPa, respectively). However, in the 90\u00b0 model, no critical regions were observed in the bolts, which showed lower stress values, reaching 26.33\u00a0MPa. In the bone, the greatest concentration of stress occurred in the region where the plate was anchored. Our results showed that the 90\u00b0 hook plate had a superior mechanical performance in fixing simulate lunate facet fractures at the distal radius. This angle led to minor displacements and minimized stress concentrations in the hardware, thus contributing to enhance the stability of this specific fracture.",

Despite its importance, medical practitioners often face challenges in communicating effectively. Because of these gaps, we aim to introduce a simulation-based training protocol to improve pediatric cardiology trainee's communication skills. This study will be conducted in collaboration with associations supporting caregivers of children with congenital heart disease. It strives to demonstrate how specific training programs can efficiently foster humanistic, patient-centered care in standard medical practice.",

When asthma is not adequately controlled, there is a higher risk of exacerbations and hospitalizations, thereby increasing the direct and indirect costs associated with the treatment and productivity loss. Overreliance on SABA and underutilization of ICS in the management of asthma can result in suboptimal treatment and poor asthma control. Patients who visit the emergency department are more likely to have poorly controlled asthma. Ensuring that these patients are provided with an evidence-based treatment plan during discharge can help reduce the risk of future exacerbations and consequently reduce the burden on the UAE healthcare system.",

However, the utility of CUR is restricted due to its low oral bioavailability. Nanoparticle drug delivery systems like mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have been extensively used due to their high specific surface area, high loading rate, and ease of modification. This study developed lactobionic acid (LA)-modified carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS)-coated MSNs to deliver CUR specifically targeting hepatocellular carcinoma. Among these nanoparticles, LA targets liver cancer cells. CMCS utilizes pH-responsive release of CUR. The LA-CMCS-MSN@CUR (MSN@CUR) were evaluated using several methods, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and zeta potential measurements. Liver cellular uptake of MSN@CUR depends on a specific LA receptor-mediated endocytosis mechanism. Additionally, MSN@CUR performed with a better antitumor effect than Cur in H22 orthotopic transplantation of liver cancer and H22 solid tumor mouse models. Treatment with MSN@CUR significantly reduced the protein of VEGF, p-PI3K, and AKT, increased the protein of caspases 3 and 8, ultimately inhibited tumor migration, and promoted apoptosis. This study provides a new path for delivery of natural active ingredients with excellent bioavailability in the antitumor field.",

        "abstract": "Children with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and intracranial injury (ICI) often receive unnecessary imaging and hospital admission, leading to avoidable burdens on patients and health systems. While most of these patients do not develop critical neurological injuries, identifying those at risk would allow for a more optimal determination of the appropriate level of initial emergency care. The Brain Injury Guidelines (BIG) were developed as a triage tool to identify adult patients with mTBI and ICI who can benefit from repeat imaging, hospital admission, or neurosurgical consultation. Here, we sought to validate BIG in children at a Level I trauma center and determine if the BIG algorithm can accurately identify which patients with mTBI/ICI have critical neurosurgical injuries. We hypothesize that the BIG can identify critical neurological injuries more accurately than the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) alone and that more severe injury according to BIG is associated with worse patient outcome. We retrospectively reviewed TBI admissions at a single center (2017-2023) using an institutional registry. Patients included (0-17 years) had an initial head computerized tomography scan with ICI and a GCS of 14-15. Patients were retrospectively classified into the BIG categories (BIG 1, 2, or 3). Medical records were reviewed to identify clinically important TBI (ciTBI): death, neurological deterioration, neurosurgical intervention, intubation >24 h, or hospital admission >48 h due to TBI. Repeat imaging studies obtained were evaluated for progression of injury. The incidence of clinically important TBI (ciTBI) and imaging progression were recorded and compared across BIG categories. Outcomes were evaluated using the Glasgow Outcome Score Extended (GOS-E) 6 months after injury. Univariable and chi-square tests were used to analyze comparisons. Overall, 804 subjects were included in the analysis of which 551 (68.5%) were transfers. Overall, 175 (21.8%) patients had a BIG 1, 402 (50.0%) a BIG 2, and 227 (28.2%) a BIG 3 injury. CiTBI occurred among 64 (8.0%) patients overall, and in 1 (0.6%), 4 (1.0%), and 59 (26.0%) of the BIG 1, 2, and 3 injuries (p p < 0.001). Amongst 471 patients (58.6%) with available 6-month patient outcomes, 98% had a GOS-E \u22655 and no outcome difference between BIG categories was observed. Risk stratification of mild TBI using BIG allowed for reasonable identification of children who subsequently develop ciTBI, suggesting that BIG classification can aid in triage and management of patients who might benefit from neurosurgical consultation, repeat imaging, and potentially transfer to a dedicated trauma center. More severe injury according to BIG was not associated with a worse patient outcome.",

        "abstract": "The hospital medicine movement thrives in a health care environment committed to providing high-quality, safe, and value-based care. Hospitalists and hospitals continually grapple with many decisions regarding adopting new interventions and deadopting established ones. These decisions span the gamut from tests, treatments, and supportive care, to care models. Traditionally, the choice to adopt one intervention over another is commonly thought of in terms of its direct impact on patient outcomes, benefits, and harms. However, the evolving landscape of health care, characterized by increasing constraints on resources necessitates a broader perspective, one that includes a thorough consideration of the economic implications. The goal is not to minimize costs but rather to maximize value, outcomes achieved for money spent. Economic evaluations of health care interventions can provide this information by quantifying value and assisting health care providers, hospitals, and health systems in deciding which intervention to adopt. Economic evaluations deal with both inputs (ie, costs) and outputs (ie, consequences). Few economic evaluations in pediatric hospital medicine have been published, and many clinicians are unfamiliar with them. This paper discusses the economic evaluation of health care interventions with special attention to the pediatric hospitalist and hospital care. The paper aims to give readers an understanding of the key concepts underlying economic evaluations.",

One hundred and twenty CML patients, 105 in chronic phase (CP), 8 in accelerated phase (AP) and 7 in blastic phase (BP) were included. Fifty-one (49%) of the CP-CML patients were in third line of treatment. The trigger for PON initiation in CP-CML was 'poor response' in 67 patients, 'poor tolerance' in 28 patients and 'response enhancement' in seven patients.

The development of PTE is associated with neurological morbidity and increases the risk of mortality. An aim of EpiBioS4Rx (Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy) was to test potential therapies to prevent the development of PTE in the lateral fluid percussion injury (LFPI) rat model of TBI, in which rats were subjected to injury at the left parietal cortex. Sodium selenate has been reported to be antiepileptogenic post-TBI in rodent models by activating protein phosphatase 2A and reducing phosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein. We aimed to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and brain uptake of sodium selenate using na\u00efve control and LFPI rats. Rats received either a single bolus dose or a single bolus dose followed by a 7-day subcutaneous minipump infusion of sodium selenate. Sodium selenate and selenium concentrations in plasma and brain were analyzed and used for PK estimation and brain exposure assessment. Selenium concentrations rapidly increased after sodium selenate administration, demonstrating biotransformation from sodium selenate to selenium. Sodium selenate and selenium PK parameters were estimated using non-compartmental analysis. Sodium selenate clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (Vd/F) varied by dose and route of administration, suggesting differences in bioavailability and nonlinear pharmacokinetics at the doses tested. Brain-to-plasma partition coefficients (AUCbrain/AUCplasma) for sodium selenate and selenium were found to be 0.7-1.3 and 0.1-0.3 following single-dose injection, respectively, indicating active transport of sodium selenate across the blood-brain barrier (BBB).",

In\u00a0vivo, C57BL/6 mice with lung tumors received ECL and radiotherapy. ECL enhanced the antiproliferative effects of x-ray irradiation, induced apoptosis in senescent cells, inhibited the NF-\u03baB pathway, reduced TGF-\u03b2 levels, and suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

Intravenous lidocaine provides analgesia during surgical procedures. This study included 70 patients who underwent gastroscopy with analgesia and aimed to evaluate the effects of intravenous lidocaine on the dose of ciprofol required to produce 50% of the maximal effect (ED50). MATERIAL AND METHODS Seventy patients scheduled for elective painless gastroscopy were randomly assigned into 2 groups: group L (n=35, received ciprofol and 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine) and group S (n=35, received ciprofol and normal saline). The primary outcomes measured were the ED50 and the 95% effective dose (ED95) of ciprofol, determined using the modified up-down sequential method and Probit analysis. Secondary outcomes included induction, operation, and recovery times; monitoring of vital signs such as mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation; and evaluation of postoperative adverse reactions, including sore throat, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and satisfaction scores from endoscopists and anesthesiologists. RESULTS The ED50 of ciprofol in group L was 0.315 mg/kg (95% CI, 0.291-0.342 mg/kg), which was significantly lower than that in group S, 0.42 mg/kg (95% CI, 0.371-0.491 mg/kg). Additionally, group L exhibited shorter induction and recovery times, a lower incidence of postoperative sore throat, and a temporary drop in blood pressure following induction. CONCLUSIONS Intravenous lidocaine during painless gastroscopy reduces the required ciprofol dose, shortens induction and recovery times, and lowers the incidence of postoperative complications, such as sore throat. These findings support its effective role in improving sedation quality and patient outcomes during gastroscopy.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the associations between domain-specific activity behavior and 24 h blood pressure.Methods: A hundred and fifty-six aging workers (mean age 62.4 [SD 1.0] years, BMI 26.2 [4.5] kg/m2, 84 % women, 75 % non-manual occupation) from the Finnish Retirement and Aging study (FIREA) were included. Standing, light and moderate-to-vigorous PA (LPA and MVPA, respectively), and SED were measured using thigh-worn accelerometers and work time, leisure-time, and non-workdays were distinguished using a diary. Ambulatory 24 h BP was analyzed as mean daytime and nighttime systolic and diastolic BP, and the nocturnal BP dipping percentage was calculated. Associations were examined with linear regression analysis adjusting for age, sex, occupation, work time mode, job strain, BMI, BP medication, and accelerometer wear time.Results: Higher work time SED associated with lower nighttime diastolic BP (B = -0.92, 95% CI -1.83, -0.01). In addition, higher work time standing associated with higher daytime diastolic BP (B = 1.34, 95% CI 0.03, 2.65) and higher work time LPA with less diastolic BP dipping (B = -3.57, 95% CI -6.80, -0.34). MVPA in any domain was not associated with ambulatory BP.Conclusions: Higher work time SED associated with a more favorable diastolic BP, and higher work time PA associated with more adverse diastolic BP among aging workers. In conclusion, work time, rather than leisure time or non-workday, activity behavior seems to associate with 24 h ambulatory BP.",

Despite technological advances in radiotherapy planning and delivery, the risk of damage to surrounding thoracic tissues remains high. Cardiac problems, including arrhythmia, heart failure and ischaemic events, occur in 20% of patients with lung cancer who undergo radiotherapy. As survival rates improve incrementally for this cohort, minimising the cardiovascular morbidity of RT is increasingly important. Problematically, the reporting of cardiac endpoints has been poor in thoracic radiotherapy clinical trials, and retrospective studies have been limited by the lack of standardisation of nomenclature and endpoints. How baseline cardiovascular profile and cardiac substructure radiation dose distribution impact the risk of cardiotoxicity is incompletely understood. As Thoracic Oncology departments seek to expand the indications for radiotherapy, and as the patient cohort becomes older and more comorbid, there is a pressing need for cardiotoxicity to be comprehensively characterised with sophisticated oncology, physics and cardio-oncology evaluations. This review synthesises the evidence base for cardiotoxicity in conventional radiotherapy, focusing on lung cancer, including current data, unmet clinical needs, and future scientific directions.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to construct and assess a machine-learning algorithm designed to forecast survival rates and risk stratification for patients with gastric neuroendocrine neoplasms (gNENs) after diagnosis. Data on patients with gNENs were extracted and randomly divided into training and validation sets using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. We developed a prediction model using 10 machine learning algorithms across 101 combinations to forecast cancer-related mortality in patients with gNENs, selecting the best model using the highest mean over a sequence of time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The performance of the final model was assessed through time-dependent ROC curves for discrimination and calibration curves for calibration. The maximum selection rank method was used to determine the best prognostic risk score threshold for classifying patients into high- and low-risk groups. Afterward, Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test were used to compare survival rates among these groups. Our study examined 775 patients with gNENs, dividing them into training and validation sets. A training set comprised 543 patients, with a median follow-up of 42 months and cumulative mortality rates of 40.0% at 1 year, 48.6% at 3 years, and 54.0% at 5 years. A validation set comprised 232 patients, with cumulative mortality rates of 29.1% at 1 year, 43.5% at 3 years, and 53.2% at 5 years. The optimal random survival forest (RSF) model (mtry\u2009=\u20094, node size\u2009=\u20095) achieved an AUC of 0.839 for survival prediction in the training set. Comprising 11 variables such as demographics, treatment details, tumor characteristics, T staging, N staging, and M staging, the RSF model revealed high predictive accuracy with AUCs of 0.92, 0.96, and 0.96 for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival, respectively, which was consistently reflected in the validation set with AUCs of 0.88, 0.92, and 0.89, respectively. Moreover, patients were risk-stratified. Although our RSF model effectively stratified patients into different prognostic groups, it needs external validation to confirm its utility for noninvasive prognostic prediction and risk stratification in gNENs. Further research is required to verify its broader clinical applicability.",

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that meet following criteria were included, urinary continence in women, using various electric stimulation treatments and evaluated outcomes related to symptoms, quality of life. Thirty RCTs were subjected to risk of bias assessment, certainty of evidence, and network meta-analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using a random-effects model, with continuous variables expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Percutaneous tibial stimulation (SMD -\u20091.86, 95% CI -\u20092.77 to -\u20090.96) and intravaginal stimulation (SMD -\u20090.97, 95% CI -\u20091.55 to -\u20090.38) significantly reduced symptom severity. Additionally, percutaneous tibial, intravaginal, transcutaneous tibial, and trans-sacral stimulations improved quality of life. Percutaneous tibial stimulation was the most effective, followed by intravaginal stimulation.

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia. Its causes are not fully understood, but it is now known that factors like mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and compromised ion channels contribute to its onset and progression. Flickering light therapy has shown promise in AD treatment, though its mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we used a rat model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced AD to evaluate the effects of 40\u00a0Hz flickering light therapy. Rats received intracerebroventricular (ICV) STZ injections, and 7 days after, they were exposed to 40\u00a0Hz flickering light for 15\u00a0min daily over seven days. Cognitive and memory functions were assessed using Morris water maze, novel object recognition, and passive avoidance tests. STZ-induced AD rats exhibited cognitive decline, elevated reactive oxygen species, amyloid beta accumulation, decreased serotonin and dopamine levels, and impaired mitochondrial function. However, light therapy prevented these effects, preserving cognitive function and synaptic plasticity. Additionally, flickering light restored mitochondrial metabolites and normalized ATP-insensitive mitochondrial calcium-sensitive potassium (mitoBKCa) channel activity, which was otherwise downregulated in AD rats. Our findings suggest that 40\u00a0Hz flickering light therapy could be a promising treatment for neurodegenerative disorders like AD by preserving synaptic and mitochondrial function.",

This study aims to address the underreporting of adverse events (AE) by implementing a TRIZ-based model to identify and overcome barriers to reporting, thus filling gaps in current reporting practices and improving incident recognition. A TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) approach was adopted, integrating with SERVQUAL methodologies to design interventions. Preintervention and postintervention surveys were conducted to evaluate changes in the recognition of adverse events and barriers to reporting. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the effectiveness of the interventions. Recognition improved and barriers to reporting AEs significantly decreased. Monthly reported cases rose from 33.7 to 50.3 (p\u2009=\u20090.000), demonstrating the effectiveness of the TRIZ-based interventions. Implementing a TRIZ-based model significantly improved adverse event reporting by enhancing the recognition of reportable events and overcoming identified barriers. Future research should explore the long-term sustainability of these interventions and their broader applicability in diverse healthcare settings.",

As this agent is mainly excreted via the kidney, we aimed to evaluate the impact of renal impairment (RI) on the early development of severe neutropenia, a dose-limiting toxicity and whose development reflects better treatment outcomes, in patients with mCRC treated with FTD/TPI. Patients with mCRC receiving FTD/TPI\u2009\u00b1\u2009bevacizumab (n\u2009=\u2009100) were divided into the RI group (creatinine clearance [CCr]\u2009<\u200990 mL/min) or control group (CCr\u2009\u2265\u200990 mL/min), and retrospectively evaluated. Severe neutropenia during the first two cycles occurred in 57.6% and 34.2% of patients in the RI and control groups, respectively, which was significantly different (P\u2009=\u20090.03) and met our primary endpoint. Furthermore, the incidence during the first cycle also differed significantly (52.5% in the RI group and 17.1% in the control group, P\u2009=\u20090.0004). Multivariate logistic regression analysis suggested that baseline RI and neutropenia were significant risk factors for early severe neutropenia (adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval: 3.07, 1.24-7.59, P\u2009=\u20090.02 for RI, and 9.76, 1.08-88.11, P\u2009=\u20090.04 for neutropenia). In conclusion, our study suggested that patients with RI can exhibit early severe neutropenia during real-world FTD/TPI treatment for mCRC.",

COVID-19 patients with CKD will face a considerably higher risk of mortality than the general population. This study developed a predictive model for assessing mortality in COVID-19-affected CKD patients, providing personalized risk prediction to optimize clinical management and reduce mortality rates. We developed machine learning algorithms to analyze 219 patients' clinical laboratory test data retrospectively. The performance of each model was assessed using a calibration curve, decision curve analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. It was found that the LightGBM model showed the most satisfied performance, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.833, sensitivity of 0.952, and specificity of 0.714. Prealbumin, neutrophil percent, respiratory index in arterial blood, half-saturated pressure of oxygen, carbon dioxide in serum, glucose, neutrophil count, and uric acid were the top 8 significant variables in the prediction model. Validation by 46 patients demonstrated acceptable accuracy. This model can serve as a powerful tool for screening CKD patients at high risk of COVID-19-related mortality and providing decision support for clinical staff, enabling efficient allocation of resources, and facilitating timely and targeted management for those who need the relevant interference urgently.",

Dermoscopy images can help clinicians for timely identification of cancer, but manual diagnosis is time-consuming, costly, and prone to human error. To conduct this, an innovative deep learning-based approach has been proposed for automatic melanoma detection. The proposed method involves preprocessing dermoscopy images to remove artifacts, enhance contrast, and cancel noise, followed by feeding them into an optimized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN is trained using an innovative metaheuristic called the Improved Chameleon Swarm Algorithm (CSA) to optimize its performance. The approach has been validated using the SIIM-ISIC Melanoma dataset and the results have been confirmed through rigorous evaluation metrics. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in accurately diagnosing melanoma from dermoscopy images by highlighting its potential as a valuable tool for clinicians in early cancer detection.",

        "abstract": "Radiotherapy has been demonstrated to be one of the most significant treatments for cervical cancer, during which accurate and efficient delineation of target volumes is critical. To alleviate the data demand of deep learning and promote the establishment and promotion of auto-segmentation models in small and medium-sized oncology departments and single centres, we proposed an auto-segmentation algorithm to determine the cervical cancer target volume in small samples based on multi-decoder and semi-supervised learning (MDSSL), and we evaluated the accuracy via an independent test cohort. In this study, we retrospectively collected computed tomography (CT) datasets from 71 pelvic cervical cancer patients, and a 3:4 ratio was used for the training and testing sets. The clinical target volumes (CTVs) of the primary tumour area (CTV1) and pelvic lymph drainage area (CTV2) were delineated. For definitive radiotherapy (dRT), the primary gross target volume (GTVp) was simultaneously delineated. According to the data characteristics for small samples, the MDSSL network structure based on 3D U-Net was established to train the model by combining clinical anatomical information, which was compared with other segmentation methods, including supervised learning (SL) and transfer learning (TL). The dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95) and average surface distance (ASD) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance. The ability of the segmentation algorithm to improve the efficiency of online adaptive radiation therapy (ART) was assessed via geometric indicators and a subjective evaluation of radiation oncologists (ROs) in prospective clinical applications. Compared with the SL model and TL model, the proposed MDSSL model displayed the best DSC, HD95 and ASD overall, especially for the GTVp of dRT. We calculated the above geometric indicators in the range of the ground truth (head-foot direction). In the test set, the DSC, HD95 and ASD of the MDSSL model were 0.80/5.85\u00a0mm/0.95\u00a0mm for CTV1 of post-operative radiotherapy (pRT), 0.84/ 4.88\u00a0mm/0.73\u00a0mm for CTV2 of pRT, 0.84/6.58\u00a0mm/0.89\u00a0mm for GTVp of dRT, 0.85/5.36\u00a0mm/1.35\u00a0mm for CTV1 of dRT, and 0.84/4.09\u00a0mm/0.73\u00a0mm for CTV2 of dRT, respectively. In a prospective clinical study of online ART, the target volume modification time (MTime) was 3-5\u00a0min for dRT and 2-4\u00a0min for pRT, and the main duration of CTV1 modification was approximately 2\u00a0min. The introduction of the MDSSL method successfully improved the accuracy of auto-segmentation for the cervical cancer target volume in small samples, showed good consistency with RO delineation and satisfied clinical requirements. In this prospective online ART study, the application of the segmentation model was demonstrated to be useful for reducing the target volume delineation time and improving the efficiency of the online ART workflow, which can contribute to the development and promotion of cervical cancer online ART.",

PBM was applied to insulin-secreting cell lines (MIN6) and rat pancreatic islets using a 670\u00a0nm light source, continuous output, with a power density of 2.8 mW/cm\u00b2, from 5\u00a0s to several 24\u00a0h. Measure of cell viability, insulin secretion, mitochondrial function, ATP content, and cellular respiration were assessed. Additionally, a diabetic rat model is used for islet transplantation (pre-conditioning with PBM or not) experiments. Short and long-term PBM exposure did not affect beta cell islets viability, insulin secretion nor ATP content. While short-term PBM (2\u00a0h) increases superoxide ion content, this was not observed for long exposure (24\u00a0h). Mitochondrial respirations were slightly decreased after PBM. In the islet transplantation model, both pre-illuminated and non-illuminated islets improved metabolic control in diabetic rats with a safety profile regarding the post-transplantation period. In summary, for the first time, long-term PBM exhibited safety in terms of cell viability, insulin secretion, energetic profiles in vitro, and post-transplantation period in vivo. Further investigation is warranted to explore PBM's protective effects under conditions of stress, aiding in the development of innovative approaches for cellular therapy.",

We aimed to determine a screening method using only computed tomography calcium scoring (CTCS) to assess HF risk. We analyzed CTCS scans from 1,998 patients (336 with type 2 diabetes) from a no-charge coronary artery calcium score registry (CLARIFY Study, Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04075162). We used deep learning to segment epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and engineered radiomic features of calcifications (\"calcium-omics\") and EAT (\"fat-omics\"). We developed models incorporating radiomics to predict risk of incident HF in patients with and without type 2 diabetes. At a median follow-up of 1.7 years, 5% had incident HF. In the overall cohort, fat-omics (C-index: 77.3) outperformed models using clinical factors, EAT volume, Agatston score, calcium-omics, and calcium-and-fat-omics to predict HF. For DM patients, the calcium-omics model (C-index: 81.8) outperformed other models. In conclusion, CTCS-based models combining calcium and fat-omics can predict incident HF, outperforming prediction scores based on clinical factors.Please check article title if captured correctly.YesPlease check and confirm that the authors and their respective affiliations have been correctly identified and amend if necessary.Yes.",

Mixed-brand CIED systems consisting of a generator from one manufacturer and at least one lead from another manufacturer are not certified for MRI. We evaluated the temporal trend in the prevalence of mixed-brand systems in the era of MRI-conditional systems. Data were analyzed on 5853 CIEDs implanted de novo between 2012 and 2022 in 81 Italian centers linked to the nationwide Home Monitoring Expert Alliance network. The percentage of mixed-brand implants was calculated by device type (pacemaker, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [ICD], cardiac resynchronization therapy [CRT] device) and over time. A mixed-brand system was implanted in 4.1% (95% CI, 3.6-4.6%) of analyzed patients or, by device type, in 4.5% (3.5-5.7%) of pacemaker patients, 1.1% (0.7-1.7%) of ICD patients, and 6.8% (5.7-7.9%) of CRT pacemaker/defibrillator patients (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Prevalence of mixed-brand implants exhibited significant temporal fluctuations, first declining from 6.6% (2012-2014) to 1.3% (2019), and then increasing to 5.1% (2022). Temporal changes were statistically significant for pacemakers (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and CRT devices (p\u2009=\u20090.001), but not for ICDs (p\u2009=\u20090.438). In the decade between 2012 and 2022, mixed-brand CIED systems were more prevalent in patients treated with pacemakers and CRT devices than in ICD recipients. A decline in the prevalence of mixed-brand systems was observed after the introduction of MRI-conditional systems, reaching a minimum in 2019, followed by a progressive increase in the subsequent years.",

        "abstract": "To analyze the factors affecting stigma and quality of life in hemiplegic stroke patients following suicide attempts in nursing homes and to provide a theoretical basis for developing interventions in clinical care. General demographic information, the Stigma Scale for Chronic Illness (SSCI), and the Quality of Life Scale (SF-36) were used to investigate 259 patients with hemiplegia after stroke following nursing home suicide from January to April 2024. Univariate statistical analyses were performed to assess the impact of potential determinants on quality of life. Multiple regression models and stratified analyses with smoothed curve fitting were used for further evaluation. Multiple regression modeling showed that the factors influencing the quality of life in hemiplegic stroke patients following suicide attempts in nursing homes were stigma, Age, marital status, education, type of occupation, monthly household income, and duration of illness. The level of quality of life before unadjusted variables was strongly associated with high school and college education (\u03b2\u2009=\u200911.9, 95% CI: 8.2-15.6; P\u2009\u200950) (\u03b2\u2009=\u20098.1, 95% CI: 4 .6-11.6; P\u2009<\u20090.0001). (\u03b2\u2009=\u20099.5, 95% CI: 6.0-13.1;P\u2009<\u20090.0001), the results were not significantly different. Curve fitting revealed threshold nonlinear associations between intrinsic and extrinsic stigma and quality of life, with quality of life decreasing as stigma increased. Conclusion Stigma is negatively correlated with the level of quality of life in hemiplegic stroke patients following suicide attempts in nursing homes. Different demographic profiles moderated patients' quality of life levels, and effective psychological intervention strategies should be used to improve patients' quality of life.",

        "abstract": "This study assessed plasma levels of essential amino acids (EAA) in drug-na\u00efve first episode psychosis (FEP) patients at diagnosis and after 10 weeks of antipsychotic treatment. Forty FEP patients were enrolled at baseline, with blood samples collected before and after a 10-week antipsychotic treatment period. Plasma EAA levels were measured using an LC/MS/MS method. Psychotic symptoms were evaluated using standardized inventories before and after treatment. A decrease in BPRS score of more than 40% was used to indicate treatment response. Thirty-five healthy volunteers served as the control group. Baseline plasma levels of Thr, Met, Leu, Lys, His, and Tyr were higher in FEP patients than in healthy controls. After 10 weeks of treatment, Leu, His, and Tyr increased further, primarily in treatment-responsive patients. Conversely, Val level was lower than controls in patients at baseline and remained unchanged after treatment. Increased EAA levels were correlated with lower (less severe) scores in positive symptom scales. Treatment non-responders had persistently low Tyr/large neutral amino acid (LNAA) ratio. Tyr/LNAA ratio increased after treatment, specifically in treatment-responders. Phe/Tyr ratio decreased post-treatment in both responder and non-responder groups. Elevated EAA levels in FEP patients may signify compensatory responses to increased physiological demand for neurotransmitters or energy. Combining specific EAA supplementation with antipsychotic treatment may enhance treatment response in these patients.",

        "abstract": "Intra-tumor immune infiltration plays a pivotal role in the interaction with tumor cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its phenotype and related spatial structure remained elusive. To address these limitations, we conducted a comprehensive study combining spatial data (38,191 spots from eight samples) and single-cell data (56,022 cells from 20 samples). Our analysis revealed two distinct infiltration patterns: immune exclusion and immune activation. Plasma cells emerged as the primary cell type within intra-tumor immune clusters. Notably, we observed the co-location of CCL19+ fibroblasts with plasma cells, which secrete chemokines and promote T-cell activation and leukocyte migration. Conversely, in immune-exclusion samples, this co-location was primarily observed in the adjacent normal area. This co-localization correlated with T cell infiltration and the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures, validated by multiplex immunofluorescence conducted on twenty HCC samples. Both CCL19+ fibroblasts and plasma cells were associated with favorable survival outcomes. In an immunotherapy cohort, HCC patients who responded favorably exhibited higher infiltration of CCL19+ fibroblasts and plasma cells. Additionally, we observed the accumulation of DKK1+ tumor cells within the tumor area in immune-exclusion samples, particularly at the tumor boundary, which inhibited the infiltration of CCL19+ fibroblasts and plasma cells into the tumor area. Furthermore, in immune-exclusion samples, the SPP1 signaling pathway demonstrated the highest activity in communication between tumor and immune clusters, and CCL19-CCR7 played a pivotal role in the self-communication of immune clusters. This study elucidates immune exclusion and immune activation patterns in HCC and identifies relevant factors contributing to immune resistance.",

        "abstract": "There is a growing interest in the health impacts of PM2.5 originating from landscape fires. We conducted a time-series study to investigate the association between daily exposure to landscape fire PM2.5 and hospital admissions for cardiovascular events in 184 major Chinese cities. We developed a machine learning model combining outputs from chemical transport models, meteorological information and observed air pollution data to determine daily concentrations of landscape fire PM2.5. Furthermore, we fitted quasi-Poisson regression to evaluate the link between landscape fire PM2.5 concentrations and cardiovascular hospitalizations in each city, and conducted random-effects meta-analysis to pool the city-specific estimates. Here we show that, on a national scale, a rise of 1-\u03bcg/m3 in landscape fire PM2.5 concentrations is positively related to a same-day 0.16% (95% confidence interval: 0.01%-0.32%) increase in hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease, 0.28% (0.12%-0.44%) for ischemic heart disease, and 0.25% (0.02%-0.47%) for ischemic stroke. The associations remain significant even after adjusting for other sources of PM2.5. Our findings indicate that transient elevation in landscape fire PM2.5 levels may increase risk of cardiovascular diseases.",

Gene expression dynamics were evaluated in 171 peripheral blood samples from 89 CML patients, including 43 longitudinally monitored individuals, and 52 healthy donors. Univariate and unsupervised analyses confirmed diminished expression of most studied immune mediators, except for TNF, ARG1 and IL4, differentiating between baseline and 3-month samples. Most of the studied mediators normalized along treatment, with a transient increase of TNF and IL6 levels at 3-months, especially in optimal responders (BCR::ABL1\u2009<\u20090.1%). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed heightened ARG1 levels and a transition from PD1/PDL1 dominance at 3 months to TIM3/GAL9 at 12 months in non-optimal responders (BCR::ABL1\u2009\u2265\u20090.1%).

A dental blue light-responsive hydrogel (LRG) was fabricated to deliver and confine live Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) in periodontal pockets, endowing the LRG with sustained antibacterial and immunomodulatory effects. The LRG was engineered through peptide modification to also promote tissue regeneration. Both in vitro and in vivo evaluations confirmed the effectiveness of this integrated therapeutic strategy, which combines antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and regenerative properties with an underlying immunomodulatory mechanism that involves suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)3 upregulation and the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway suppression in macrophages. Demonstrating a new paradigm, this proof of concept highlights the synergistic integration of live organisms and synthetic material engineering in a chairside treatment to address the multifaceted etiology of periodontitis.",

However, its efficacy and safety in patients with cancer remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of MT against large vessel occlusion between patients with and without cancer. A total of 71 patients who underwent MT from August 2014 to November 2021 were included in this study. Patients with cancer and/or a history of cancer (n = 16) were included in the with cancer group and the remaining patients in the without cancer group (n = 55). The frequency of preoperative tissue plasminogen activator administration was significantly lower in the with cancer group (n = 2 [12.5%]) than in the without cancer group (n = 24 [43.6%]). However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of treatment time, pass frequency, thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grade, modified Rankin scale score at 1 week after treatment [mRS (1w) ], modified Rankin scale score at discharge [mRS (ENT) ], modified Rankin scale score at 90 days after treatment [mRS (90 days) ], and length of hospital stay (days). In the multivariate analysis, if the objective variables were mRS (1w) and mRS (90 days), the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and preonset mRS scores were considered significant variables. The presence or absence of cancer was not considered an independent factor of mRS (1w), mRS (ENT), or mRS (90 days). Aggressive treatment may be recommended to patients with cancer and/or a history of cancer who present with a systemic condition that can be managed with MT.",

        "abstract": "Healthcare decision making, including regulatory and reimbursement decisions, is based on uncertain assessments of clinical and economic value. This arises from the evidence supporting those assessments being uncertain, incomplete, or even absent. Qualitative, structured expert elicitation (SEE) is a valuable tool for extracting expert knowledge about an uncertain quantity and formulating that knowledge as a probability distribution. This creates a useful input to decision modeling and support, particularly in areas with limited evidence, such as advanced therapy products, precision medicine, rare diagnoses, and other areas with high uncertainty. Structured SEE protocols are used to improve the transparency, accuracy, and consistency of quantitative judgments from experts, limiting the effect of heuristics and biases. This task force report introduces 5 commonly used protocols for SEE (Sheffield elicitation framework; modified Delphi method; Cooke's classical method; investigate, discuss, estimate, aggregate protocol; and the Medical Research Council reference protocol). It describes the common elements of SEE, discusses how these protocols differ in their implementation of those elements and illustrates the use of the protocols. The report then reviews the relevant constraints on implementing SEE within the context of healthcare decision making and considers the strengths and weaknesses of these protocols in light of those considerations. Because this is an introductory report on an emerging topic, specific recommendations on practice are not made. However, there are broad recommendations based on the suitability of the different protocols in various decision contexts. The report concludes with recommendations for further research to better guide future practice.",

We propose that some of the approaches used for implementation well after a trial has ended can be incorporated into the design of phase 3 trials to foster early post-trial implementation. Approaches include, but are not limited to, engaging broad stakeholders including patients, clinicians, and decision-makers in trial advisory boards; using less restrictive eligibility criteria that ensure both internal validity and generalizability; having trial protocols reviewed by regulators; integrating trial execution with the health care system; evaluating and addressing barriers and facilitators to deployment of the intervention; and undertaking cost-effectiveness and cost utility analyses across jurisdictions.

It includes models based on refractive power and ocular biological characteristics, such as those using parameters such as refractive power, axial length, and percentile curves for prediction; models combined with environmental factors, which explore the relationship between myopia in school-age children and the age of onset, parents' myopia, education, and various living environmental factors; models based on genetic factors, which predict by evaluating parents' myopia status and single nucleotide polymorphisms discovered in genome-wide association studies. In addition, the article also introduces the application of artificial intelligence in myopia prediction, such as machine learning and deep learning algorithms that can predict changes in axial length growth and refractive power. These research advances provide a reference for establishing more accurate myopia prediction models and help achieve precise and personalized myopia prevention and control.",

Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 19 patients with uveal leiomyoma confirmed by histopathological examination in Beijing Tongren Hospital from January 2018 to May 2023. All patients underwent local resection of the tumor. Clinical data of the patients, such as gender, age, clinical manifestations, tumor location, size, and B-scan ultrasound examinations were collected. The pathological morphological characteristics of the tissue (cell type) and the expression of the immune markers, including smooth muscle actin, actin, and neural cell adhesion molecule (CD56), were evaluated. Results: Among the 19 intraocular leiomyoma patients, there were 5 males and 14 females. The average age was (38.9\u00b113.7) years, ranging from 14 to 64 years. The course of the disease ranged from 1 to 36 months with an average of (9.3\u00b18.7) months. The most common clinical manifestation was blurred vision (12/19), followed by decreased vision (4/19), increased IOP (2/19), and visual occlusion (1/19) in patients. The tumor was located in the ciliary body in 10 female and 5 male patients, including 2 patients with the iris involved, and in the choroid in 4 female patients. Two patients with a history of breast fibronenoma had uveal leiomyoma in the ciliary body and the choroid, respectively. One patient with a history of uterine leiomyoma suffered uveal leiomyoma in the ciliary body. B-scan ultrasonography showed that the tumor was a solid and medium-low echoic lesion with a clear boundary in all eyes. We divided these leiomyomas into two histopathological types: spindle cell type (15/19) and round cell type (4/19). Immunohistochemical staining disclosed smooth muscle actin and actin were expressed in all tumor cells (19/19, 100%), and CD56 was positive in 16 of 19 eyes (84.2%). The positive expression rates of estrogen and progesterone were 0/19 and 2/19. During the follow-up of 7 to 71 months after surgery, no tumor metastasis occurred. Only 1 male patient had tumor recurrence. Conclusions: The most common site of uveal leiomyoma is the ciliary body, the major clinical manifestation is blurred vision, and the prognosis is good. Most of the tumors are spindle cell tumors, with myogenic and neurogenic histological characteristics. Although uveal leiomyoma is more frequently found in women of reproductive age, it shows no significant correlation with estrogen and progestational hormones.",

Of these 140 publications, 67 were published in journals outside of JVIR and cited 1753 times. The median impact factor of journals outside of JVIR was 4.98 (range: 0.33 to 18.8). The remaining 73 publications were published in JVIR, with a peak impact factor of 3.7, leading to 1687 citations. There were 3440 citations, and the conversion rate of grants (282) to publications (140) was 48%. The median relative citation ratio was 0.68 (range: 0 to 19.42). ANOVA testing per grant mechanism demonstrated a statistically significant correlation (p<0.001) between a particular grant mechanism and the number of publications. Furthermore, linear regression demonstrated a significant increase in the mean impact factor of publications with respect to time, with more recent publications published in higher-impact journals.",

Despite increased awareness, clinical management of this common cardiovascular complication remains challenging, with no consensus on its diagnosis or treatment.

The purpose of the current study is to detail and critically examine recruitment and retention procedures across the PMC's large-scale multi-site pragmatic clinical trials, with attention to efforts made by trialists to diversify their study samples. Team members from 11 pragmatic clinical trials completed semi-structured interviews that focused on the meaning of diversity to the trial teams when planning the composition of their samples, methods used to recruit and retain diverse samples of patients, and planned analyses that take into consideration diverse subgroups of patients. Nearly 18,000 patients have been enrolled across trials, 22% of whom were assigned female sex at birth and 34% of whom identify with a marginalized race or ethnicity. Respondents highlighted study site selection, formation of partnerships with patient groups, and leveraging of data informatics as strategies that aided in the recruitment of patients diverse in terms of birth sex, race, and ethnicity. Notably, trialists adopted a narrow definition of diversity that did not take into consideration multiple intersecting identities of trial participants. Based on experiences of the PMC, we provide 14 recommendations on ways to diversify patient samples in clinical pain research. PERSPECTIVE: This article describes challenges posed, and opportunities provided, with pain pragmatic clinical trial designs, emphasizing approaches that optimize the inclusion of social identity groups that have historically been under-represented in pain research.",

        "abstract": "Temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS) using extracorporeal life support (ECLS), has been widely implemented in patients with cardiogenic shock (CS), although evidence regarding its efficacy and safety remains unclear. This lack of clarity has recently raised concerns about the role of tMCS in CS management. Conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the context of CS poses significant challenges due to ethical considerations and logistical complexities. In response to these challenges, emulated trials (ETs) are emerging as a promising alternative. By incorporating design features from idealized RCTs, they use robust and rigorous methods to assess the efficacy and safety of health interventions in real-life settings, using observational data. In our manuscript, we highlight the complementary nature of RCT and ETs by evaluating tMCS for CS patients. While RCTs follow a rigorous experimental design and provide reliable evidence, ETs can swiftly estimate the risk-benefit ratio without encountering logistical barriers thereby offering clinicians' early reassurance about the potential benefits of routinely used interventions. Furthermore, ETs offer potential value in unethical situations (refractory cardiac arrest or \u00ab crash and burn \u00bb CS) where interventional therapies, such as tMCS, are used as a last resort.",

Breast reduction surgery has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment for many women with back pain from macromastia. Awareness among spine specialists may prevent unneeded spinal intervention prompted by an overestimation of the contribution of vertebral degenerative changes to axial pain in affected women. This review aims to broaden spine providers' understanding of macromastia and its evaluation and treatment, including the role of breast reduction surgery to lessen axial pain.",

This study investigates abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in women of childbearing age taking oral anticoagulants-Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) or Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOAC)-for venous thromboembolism through a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. Uterine bleeding was assessed using the Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC) and hemoglobin (Hb) values during anticoagulation compared to prior therapy. The number of unplanned medical visits for bleeding complications was also calculated. From June 2014 to November 2023, 110 women were recruited (median age, 36 years). PBAC scores correlated with Hb values at baseline and during therapy (ANOVA, p<0.01), with a significant difference in Hb values before and during anticoagulant therapy (\u0394 Hb) among groups (ANOVA, p=0.034). Seventeen women (15.4%) reported fibroids, experiencing a greater reduction in Hb values during anticoagulant administration than women without fibroids (\u0394 0.3, IQR -0.8, 2.9 vs -0.5, IQR -1.2, 0.3; p=0.012). Women with fibroids required more frequent unplanned medical consultations for bleeding (mean visits 5 vs 4 respectively; Poisson regression, p<0.05). Among women with fibroids, those taking apixaban showed smaller Hb changes than those on other oral anticoagulants (ANOVA, p=0.047). This difference persisted even after adjusting for potential confounders (MANOVA, p=0.004). Women of childbearing potential taking OAC frequently experience changes in Hb values and PBAC scores during treatment, with fibroids playing a significant role.",

MDK has demonstrated greater accuracy than existing biomarkers. Serum MDK is a valuable indicator for the non-invasive early detection of tumors. It dynamically changes following surgical tumor excision and prior to recurrence, facilitating prognosis and treatment response evaluation. However, existing methods struggle to achieve the sensitivity required for clinical applications. Herein, we developed a triple-mode biosensor with oriented self-construction and built-in error-checking for rapid, sensitive, and convenient MDK detection. The sensor construction adhered to the principle of achieving oriented and strong covalent connections to ensure high sensitivity. Biosynthesized quantum dots (BQDs) were introduced to orient antibodies, enhancing the exploration of active binding sites and significantly increasing antibody-capturing ability. To further enhance sensitivity and signal amplification, Au@Pt nanorods-Ab2 (MF-Probe) were used as multifunctional probes, incorporating an error-checking mechanism to minimize false results. Detection was feasible using an electrochemical workstation, a microplate reader, and even a mobile phone. The sensor exhibited a wide linear range from 5\u00a0fg/mL to 100\u00a0ng/mL and a low limit of detection (LOD) of 1.620\u00a0fg/mL. It accurately distinguished MDK levels in the serum of healthy donors and cancer patients. Compared to existing ELISA kits, it exhibited a lower LOD and a more sensitive response to trace MDK, suggesting it is a promising tool for cancer diagnosis and prognostic evaluation.",

This study designated sampling locations within a WWTP situated in Xi'an, a major city in northwest China. The airborne bacterial concentration, taxonomic composition, and the associated health risks were analyzed in the aeration tanks with bottom microporous aeration system. The Anaerobic-Anoxic-Oxic (AAO) tank emitted significantly higher culturable bacteria (1.58\u00d7104 CFU m-3 in spring, 6.69\u00d7103 CFU m-3 in winter) compared to Double-ditch (DE) oxidation ditch and aerated grit chamber (AGC) chamber, aligning with 16S rDNA quantification results. The bacterial concentrations are higher in spring than that in winter, with the AAO tank posing the highest exposure risk during the spring season. The dominant genera in the air samples include Cutibacterium, Lawsonella, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Aeromonas. Among the identified genus, 139 bacterial genera were identified as potential human pathogens like Neisseria, Moraxella, Haemophilus, Escherichia-Shigella and Streptococcus. These pathogens further elevate exposure risks from WWTP bioaerosols. This study provides relevant information on the seasonal health risk variations tied to bioaerosol emissions from diverse aeration tanks with bottom microporous aeration system in the mega city of northwest China, emphasizing the imperative to enhance the management and control measures for bioaerosols originating from the AAO tank.",

MP conjugated hydrogels could modulate the immunoinflammatory microenvironment of SCI and sustain neuron survival. The multi-stiffness hydrogels were fabricated by adjusting concentration ratios to evaluate appropriate mechanical stimuli. In a model of dorsal root ganglion, MP grafted hydrogels with mechanical signals similar to those of adult rat spinal cords demonstrated superior efficacy in promoting dorsal root ganglion growth. MP grafted hydrogels could regulate the immune-inflammatory microenvironment, promote recovery of both motor function and sensory functions.

Nevertheless, the intrinsic patterns of fundus lesions aggravated challenges in DR detection process. Therefore, we proposed a novel multi-lesion segmentation guided deep attention network (MSGDA-Net) for accurate and automated DR detection, consisting of a DR lesion segmentation pathway as an auxiliary task to produce a lesion regional prior knowledge and a DR grading pathway to extract local fine-grained features and long-range dependency. In DR lesion segmentation pathway, we designed a Multi-Scale Attention Block (MSAB) and a Lesion-Aware Relation Block (LARB) to allow interactions among multi-lesion features for alleviating ambiguity in lesion segmentation, generating lesion regional prior knowledge. As for DR grading pathway, we presented a Spatial-Fusion Block (SFB) to enhance the lesion-related local fine-grained feature representations and eliminate irrelevant noise information under the guidance of the resulting lesion regional priors, while constructed an Enhanced Self-Attention Block (ESAB) to optimally fuse fine-grained features from SFB with long-range global-context information for grading DR. The experimental results showed that our MSGDA-Net not only achieved state-of-the-art performance in the tasks of multi-lesion segmentation and DR grading, reaching up to 49.21\u00a0% Dice, 38.05\u00a0% IoU and 51.15\u00a0% AUPR for DR lesion segmentation on the DDR dataset, as well as accuracy values of 75.00\u00a0% and 87.18\u00a0% for DR grading on local newly-built VisionDR and publicly available APTOS datasets, but also manifested good generalization and robustness on cross-data evaluation.

In bone transplantation, new approaches are needed to provide surgeons with accurate tissue measurements while minimizing contamination risks and avoiding repeated freeze-thaw cycles of banked tissues. This study evaluates three prominent non-contact 3D scanning methods-structured light scanning (SLG), laser scanning (LAS), and photogrammetry (PHG)-to support tissue banking operations. We conducted a thorough examination of each technology and the precision of the 3D scanned bones using relevant anatomical specimens under sterile conditions. Cranial caps were scanned as separate inner and outer surfaces, automatically aligned, and merged with post-processing. A colorimetric analysis based on CIEDE2000 was performed, and the results were compared with questionnaires distributed among neurosurgeons. The findings indicate that certain 3D scanning methods were more appropriate for specific bones. Among the technologies, SLG emerged as optimal for tissue banking, offering a superior balance of accuracy, minimal distortion, cost-efficiency, and ease of use. All methods slightly underestimated the volume of the specimens in their virtual models. According to the colorimetric analysis and the questionnaires given to the neurosurgeons, our low-cost PHG system performed better than others in capturing cranial caps, although it exhibited the least dimensional accuracy. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights for surgeons and tissue bank personnel in selecting the most efficient 3D non-contact scanning technology and optimizing protocols for modernized tissue banking. Future work will advance towards smart healthcare solutions, explore the development of virtual tissue banks.",

        "abstract": "Brain gliomas are a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Existing glioma segmentation approaches using multi-modal inputs often rely on a simplistic approach of stacking images from all modalities, disregarding modality-specific features that could optimize diagnostic outcomes. This paper introduces STE-Net, a spatial reinforcement hybrid Transformer-based tri-branch multi-modal evidential fusion network designed for conflict-free brain tumor segmentation. STE-Net features two independent encoder-decoder branches that process distinct modality sets, along with an additional branch that integrates features through a cross-modal channel-wise fusion (CMCF) module. The encoder employs a spatial reinforcement hybrid Transformer (SRHT), which combines a Swin Transformer block and a modified convolution block to capture richer spatial information. At the output level, a conflict-free evidential fusion mechanism (CEFM) is developed, leveraging the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory and a conflict-solving strategy within a complex network framework. This mechanism ensures balanced reliability among the three output heads and mitigates potential conflicts. Each output is treated as a node in the complex network, and its importance is reassessed through the computation of direct and indirect weights to prevent potential mutual conflicts. We evaluate STE-Net on three public datasets: BraTS2018, BraTS2019, and BraTS2021. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that STE-Net outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. Statistical analysis further confirms the strong correlation between predicted tumors and ground truth. The code for this project is available at https://github.com/whotwin/STE-Net.",

However, its potential as a diagnostic hallmark for tuberculosis (TB) has yet to be explored. Here, we comprehensively analyze miRNA profiles in exosomes derived from the plasma of active TB patients and healthy persons to evaluate its efficacy in TB diagnosis. Small-RNA transcriptomic profiling analysis identified a total of 14 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs), among which the diagnostic potential of exosomal miR-766-3p, miR-376c-3p, miR-1283, and miR-125a-5p was evident from their respective areas under the ROC curve, which were 0.8963, 0.8313, 0.8097, and 0.8050, respectively. The bioinformatics analysis and Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that the 3'-untranslated region of natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (NRAMP1) mRNA was targeted by miR-766-3p. The exosomes could be internalized by the A549 cells in co-culturing experiments. Furthermore, both increased miR-766-3p and decreased NRAMP1 expression were observed in Mtb-infected A549 cells. MiR-766-3p overexpression reduced the NRAMP1 levels, but increased intracellular Mtb, suggesting that miR-766-3p may facilitate Mtb survival by targeting NRAMP1. Moreover, miR-766-3p-transfected cells exhibited increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation following Mtb infection. Taken together, circulating exosomal miR-766-3p, miR-1283, miR-125a-5p, and miR-376c-3p may serve as candidate hallmarks for TB diagnosis where the presence of miR-766-3p seems associated with the vulnerability to Mtb infection in humans and could be a new molecular target for therapeutic intervention of TB.",

We aimed to validate the prognostic value of the 2022 ELN classification (ELN22) evaluating 1,570 newly diagnosed AML patients (median age, 56 years) treated with cytarabine-based intensive chemotherapy regimens. As compared to the 2017 ELN classification (ELN17), allocating 595 (38%), 413 (26%) and 562 (36%) patients to the favorable, intermediate and adverse risk category, ELN22 risk was favorable, intermediate, and adverse in 575 (37%), 410 (26%), and 585 (37%) patients, respectively. Risk group allocation was revised in 340 patients (22%). Most patients were re-classified into ELN22 intermediate or ELN22 adverse risk group. The allocation of patients according to the ELN22 risk categories resulted in a significantly distinct event-free survival (EFS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS). As compared to ELN17, reallocation according to the ELN22 recommendations resulted in a significantly improved prognostic discrimination for OS (3-year area under the curve (AUC) 0.71 vs. 0.67). In patients with ELN22 favorable risk AML, co-occurring MR gene mutations did not significantly impact outcome. Within the ELN22 adverse risk group, we observed marked survival differences across mutational groups (5-year OS rate of 21% and 3% in patients with myelodysplasia-related (MR) gene mutations and TP53-mutated patients, respectively). In patients harboring MR gene mutations, EZH2-, STAG2- and ZRSR2-mutated patients showed an intermediate-like OS. In patients with secondary AML and those who underwent allogeneic HCT, EFS and OS significantly differed between ELN22 risk groups, while prognostic abilities of ELN17 and ELN22 classifications were similar. In conclusion, the ELN22 risk stratification improves prognostic discrimination in a large cohort of intensively treated AML patients. Given the heterogeneous outcome in patients with MR gene alterations, ranging between those of intermediate and adverse risk patients, we suggest reevaluation of risk allocation in these patients.",

However, effective therapeutic strategies for ischemic stroke are still lacking. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, and the pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 has shown promising neuroprotective effects. In this study, we utilized positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the HDAC6-specific radioligand [18F]PB118 to investigate the dynamic changes of HDAC6 expression in the brain after ischemic injury. The results revealed a significant decline in [18F]PB118 uptake in the ipsilateral hemisphere on the first day after ischemia, followed by a gradual increase on days 4 and 7. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of HDAC6 inhibitors, we developed a novel brain-permeable and potent HDAC6 inhibitor, PB131, and assessed its neuroprotective effects in an ischemic stroke mouse model. PET imaging studies demonstrated that PB131 treatment alleviated the decline in [18F]PB118 uptake and reduced the infarct size in middle cerebral artery occlusion mice. Furthermore, PET imaging with the TSPO-specific radioligand [18F]FEPPA revealed that PB131 significantly suppressed neuroinflammation in the ischemic brain. These findings provide insights into the dynamic changes of HDAC6 in ischemic stroke and the potential of HDAC6 inhibitors as novel therapeutic agents for this condition.",

        "abstract": "The increasing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data enable researchers to explore cellular heterogeneity and gene expression profiles, offering a high-resolution view of the transcriptome at the single-cell level. However, the dropout events, which are often present in scRNA-seq data, remaining challenges for downstream analysis. Although a number of studies have been developed to recover single-cell expression profiles, their performance may be hindered due to not fully exploring the inherent relations between genes. To address the issue, we propose scDTL, a deep transfer learning based approach for scRNA-seq data imputation by harnessing the bulk RNA-sequencing information. We firstly employ a denoising autoencoder trained on bulk RNA-seq data as the initial imputation model, and then leverage a domain adaptation framework that transfers the knowledge learned by the bulk imputation model to scRNA-seq learning task. In addition, scDTL employs a parallel operation with a 1D U-Net denoising model to provide gene representations of varying granularity, capturing both coarse and fine features of the scRNA-seq data. Finally, we utilize a cross-channel attention mechanism to fuse the features learned from the transferred bulk imputation model and U-Net model. In the evaluation, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that scDTL could outperform other state-of-the-art methods in the quantitative comparison and downstream analyses.",

Particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, these conditions are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, socioeconomic challenges, and considerable psychological and social integration difficulties for affected individuals. This study aims to evaluate the epidemiological profile of patients with these conditions treated at a newly established specialized center in the Brazilian Amazonian Region. Data were extracted from medical records at a Reference Service for Clefts and Craniofacial Anomalies in the north of Brazil, covering the period from 2016 to 2020. These were compared with data from the official epidemiological health portal of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The study recorded a total of 852 patients, with males comprising 54.4%. The predominant type of cleft was the transforaminal cleft, which accounted for 69.4% of cases, followed by postforamen clefts at 17.3%. The left side was more frequently affected in 63% of the cases. The primary surgical intervention performed was cheiloplasty, representing 39.5% of all procedures. Notably, 52% of the patients were from the interior regions of the state. The 2019 DataSUS data indicated a prevalence of cleft lip and palate in the State of Par\u00e1 of 4.26 per 10,000 live births. However, data from this single specialized hospital showed a higher prevalence of 7.58 per 10,000 live births.

Acute appendicitis can present with a well-recognized clinical presentation with abdominal pain which localize in the right lower quadrant. This presentation is more typical in men than in women of child baring age. Several clinical and laboratory calculations can be used to increase the likelihood of making a correct diagnosis. Various imaging modalities can be used to make the diagnosis which include ultrasound, computer tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Each study has well known sensitivity/specificity of positive predictive value of making the diagnosis of appendicitis. The management of acute appendicitis is based on the presentation of the patient and dividing it into uncomplicated and complicated disease. Each requires management with antibiotics and followed with timely appendectomy. Recent studies have demonstrated nonoperative management of uncomplicated appendicitis without no fecalith that can be managed with antibiotics alone. Complicated acute appendicitis should undergo timely surgical intervention. Patients presenting with a large appendiceal abscess or phlegmon should undergo percutaneous drainage and antibiotic management. There are certain patient populations that should be considered for surgical intervention. Pregnant patients as well as immunosuppressed patients should undergo timely surgical intervention to decrease the risk of complications. This review outlines the current principles of the diagnosis, imaging, and treatment of acute appendicitis based on the best available evidence of acute appendicitis in adults.",

In this study we evaluate the Vaginal Panel Real-Time PCR kit (qPCR test) against routinely used diagnostics for detection of bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), and trichomoniasis. A total of 1011 vaginal swab specimens were analyzed. The routinely diagnostic methods for BV was Gram stain-based Nugent score. VVC presence was detected by culture, and Candida species were identified using MALDI-TOF MS. Trichomonas vaginalis was identified by culture in a selective medium. Molecular analyses were conducted on the MagXtract\u00ae 3200 System and analyzed using the CFX96\u2122 Real-Time PCR Detection System. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the qPCR test compared to the reference method for BV diagnosis was 93.1%, 88.8%, 90.1% and 92.2%, respectively, with a Kappa value of 0.82. For Candida species, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 96.0%, 98.4%, 95.3%, and 98.7%, respectively. The qPCR test detected 32 additional positive samples for Candida not reported by the routinely used diagnostics. For trichomoniasis, the qPCR test identified T. vaginalis in fifteen specimens, despite no microscopic detection in cultured specimens. Our results demonstrate that the Vaginal Panel Real-Time PCR kit shows optimal concordance with routinely used diagnostics for diagnosing vaginitis. Furthermore, enhancing detection of T. vaginalis. However, further validation studies are necessary to confirm its full diagnostic accuracy. The use of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) provides rapid and accurate diagnosis, crucial for early detection and treatment of vaginitis.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare are driving research into solutions that can provide personalized guidance. For these solutions to be used as clinical decision support tools, the results provided must be interpretable and consistent with medical knowledge. To this end, this study explores the use of explainable AI to characterize the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A dataset of 9613 records from patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was classified into three categories of cardiovascular risk (low, moderate, and high), as estimated by the Framingham Risk Score. Counterfactual explanations were generated with two different methods, MUlti Counterfactuals via Halton sampling (MUCH) and Diverse Counterfactual Explanation (DiCE). An error control mechanism is introduced in the preliminary classification phase to reduce classification errors and obtain meaningful and representative explanations. Furthermore, the concept of counterfactual conformity is introduced as a new way to validate single counterfactual explanations in terms of their conformity, based on proximity with respect to the factual observation and plausibility. The results indicate that explanations generated with MUCH are generally more plausible (lower implausibility) and more distinguishable (higher discriminative power) from the original class than those generated with DiCE, whereas DiCE shows better availability, proximity and sparsity. Furthermore, filtering the counterfactual explanations by eliminating the non-conformal ones results in an additional improvement in quality. The results of this study suggest that combining counterfactual explanations generation with conformity evaluation is worth further validation and expert assessment to enable future development of support tools that provide personalized recommendations for reducing individual risk by targeting specific subsets of biomarkers.",

        "abstract": "Shared decision-making has been increasingly discussed as a communication practice within veterinary medicine, and it is gaining more traction for diagnostic and treatment planning conversations and specifically offering a spectrum of care. This teaching tip describes the data from an investigation of veterinarians' shared decision-making in a pre-test/post-test communication skills training intervention that used a client-centered, skills-based communication approach. Practice teams from a purposive sample of four companion animal veterinary clinics in Texas participated in a 15-month communication skills intervention, including interactive group workshops and one-on-one communication coaching. To assess the outcome of the intervention, for nine participating veterinarians, appointments recorded pre- (n\u00a0=\u00a085) and post-intervention (n\u00a0=\u00a0 85) were analyzed using the Observer OPTION 5 instrument to assess shared decision-making. The intervention effect was evaluated using mixed logistic regression, adjusting for appointment type. The communication intervention did not significantly impact participating veterinarians' demonstration of shared decision-making (pre\u00a0=\u00a025.42, n\u00a0=\u00a055; post\u00a0=\u00a028.03, n\u00a0=\u00a056; p\u00a0=\u00a00.36). Appointment type was significantly associated with veterinarians' OPTION 5 scores (p\u00a0=\u00a0.0004) and health problem appointments (OPTION 5\u00a0=\u00a030.07) demonstrated greater shared decision-making than preventive care appointments (OPTION 5\u00a0=\u00a022.81). Findings suggest that client-centered, skills-based training traditionally used in veterinary curricula and continuing education may not foster the use of shared decision-making, which is a higher-order communication approach that may require a dedicated process-oriented training. This teaching tip highlights the need for a targeted stepwise approach to teach shared decision-making.",

This study explored students' experiences and development of competence in a DVE program. Veterinarians evaluated 120 final-year students' performances at the end of each 4-week clinical rotation using a four-point RIME (Reporter, Interpreter, Manager, Educator) scale. Evaluation items linked to 16 competencies, including the AVMA's Council on Education's (COE) nine competencies and the North American Veterinary Medical Education Consortium's (NAVMEC) seven competencies. Students were surveyed at graduation about their clinical year experience and preparedness for an expanded set of 21 competencies/subcompetencies derived from those published by the AVMA COE, NAVMEC, and the American Association of Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC). Students logged 56,305 cases in ePortfolios during the year, averaging 469 cases per student. Competency scores increased during clinical year (p p < .001), though different competencies improved at a similar rate. Seven students required remediation, which consisted of repeating one or more rotations with individualized goals and oversight; all remediated successfully. Students reported diverse spectrum of care experiences and praised the amount of hands-on experience. Students suggested additional oversight for some clinical affiliates. In conclusion, the DVE program provided a robust number and diversity of cases. Students demonstrated longitudinal gains in competency scores and reported confidence in performing competencies upon graduation. The DVE program appeared effective at meeting programmatic competency goals.",

The sensitivity and specificity of current biomarkers, however, are frequently limited. Our study aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 3 (NFATc3), in pediatric bronchial asthma, focusing on its diagnostic and prognostic value for disease severity and recurrence. This observational, prospective case-control study involved 200 pediatric patients with bronchial asthma and 200 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, from January 2020 to January 2023. Follow-up varied from 1 to 3 years. We measured levels of NFATc3 and inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. NFATc3 and IL-1\u03b2 levels at enrollment were markedly higher in patients with acute exacerbations and those classified as severe, compared with their less severe counterparts. Throughout the study, NFATc3, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 levels significantly increased in severe or acutely exacerbating cases. The diagnostic value of NFATc3 was assessed through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, which showed its potential in diagnosing bronchial asthma and identifying severe cases. Spearman's analysis confirmed positive associations between peak NFATc3 and cytokine levels. Importantly, disease type, NFATc3 values at enrollment, as well as peak IL-6 levels were identified as independent risk factors for severe bronchial asthma. Elevated NFATc3 is linked with the severity of pediatric bronchial asthma and serves as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and severity prediction, emphasizing its role in guiding treatment strategies.",

        "abstract": "Nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key transcription factor in the antioxidant response and is associated with various chronic diseases. The aim of this study was to explore the action of esculetin, a natural dihydroxy coumarin, on attenuating middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and reperfusion, and whether its effect is dependent on Nrf2 activation, as well as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) inhibition. Two doses of esculetin (20 and 40 mg/kg) were tested on rats with MCAO reperfusion. Neurological deficiency, oxidative stress, and pathological analyses were performed to evaluate its effect. An in vitro analysis was also used to confirm whether its action was dependent on the Nrf2/HO-1/NQO-1 pathway. Compared with MCAO reperfusion rats, esculetin improved infarct volume and increased normal-shaped neuron cells by decreasing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1\u03b2 levels. The oxidative stress parameter malondialdehyde (MDA) decreased and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) ratio increased after esculetin treatment. Moreover, esculetin inhibited NF-\u03baB activation induced by MCAO. In vitro, hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) impaired the viability of rat neuron cells and esculetin showed a neuron protection effect on cells. Nrf2 inhibitor Brusatol inhibited the activation of Nrf2, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1) caused by esculetin and abolished its protection effect. Esculetin protected cerebral neurons from ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting NF-\u03baB and Nrf2/HO-1/NQO-1 activation.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of olmesartan/amlodipine (OLM/AML) single-pill combination (SPC) therapy using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in non-responders to valsartan or candesartan monotherapy. Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is the most prevalent form of hypertension in middle-aged and elderly individuals. Patients aged over 55 years who did not achieve the target systolic blood pressure (SBP < 140\u00a0mmHg) with valsartan 80\u00a0mg or candesartan 8\u00a0mg for at least 4 weeks were included. Doses were escalated from 20/5\u00a0mg to 40/5\u00a0mg and finally to 40/10\u00a0mg of OLM/AML SPC until patients reached the target SBP. Efficacy was assessed via ABPM by comparing baseline values with those in the 12th week. Office blood pressure (OBP) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) were assessed at baseline, weeks 4, 8, and 12. Fifty-four patients (average age 64 \u00b1 6 years; 33 males) participated. The 24-h mean BPs decreased significantly from an average of 146.2 \u00b1 12.7/93.3 \u00b1 9.2\u00a0mmHg to 129.7 \u00b1 14.3/83.4 \u00b1 10.7\u00a0mmHg (p < 0.001), and pulse pressures (PPs) from ABPM were reduced (p < 0.001). Additionally, significant reductions in night-time SBP standard deviations (SDs) (14.7 \u00b1 4.7\u00a0vs. 12.5 \u00b1 3.9, p = 0.029) were observed at 12 weeks compared to baseline. OBPs significantly dropped from 151.1 \u00b1 9.7/89.3 \u00b1 8.3\u00a0mmHg to 125.5 \u00b1 13.8/77.8 \u00b1 8.8\u00a0mmHg after 12 weeks of SPC therapy (p < 0.001). Reductions in PPs of OBP and baPWVs were also observed. OLM/AML SPC therapy effectively reduced the 24-h mean BP, as measured by ABPM, in hypertensive patients over 55 years old who failed to achieve a target SBP (< 140\u00a0mmHg) with angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) monotherapy using valsartan 80\u00a0mg or candesartan 8\u00a0mg.
